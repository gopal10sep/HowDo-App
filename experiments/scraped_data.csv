1: Understanding Your Mindset: A Key to Unlocking Growth
The Importance of a Growth Mindset in Business Success

For entrepreneurs and executives, fostering a growth mindset leads to innovation, increased job satisfaction, enhanced problem-solving, and a competitive edge in today's dynamic market.
When to Cultivate a Growth Mindset: Identifying the Need
Embracing a growth mindset becomes vital when:
Facing challenges that demand resilience.
Seeking to foster continuous learning within your team.
Aiming to drive innovation and creativity.
Enhancing leadership skills to inspire others.
Whether you're navigating setbacks or aiming to elevate your leadership, a growth mindset is your catalyst for transformation.
Identify Your Starting Point
In the demanding landscape of today's business world, your mindset is the lens through which you approach challenges, seize opportunities, and drive growth. Where do you stand on this spectrum? Do you have a fixed mindset that sees abilities as static, or a growth mindset that believes in the potential for development and change?
Understanding where you currently stand is the cornerstone of your growth mindset journey. This section offers a free self-assessment to pinpoint your mindset and guide your transformation. By assessing your current perspective, you lay the foundation for cultivating key traits such as resilience, adaptability, and innovation.

What If You Discover a Fixed Mindset?
If you find that you lean more towards a fixed mindset: don't worry, you're not alone. Many successful entrepreneurs and executives, including me, have started from this point.

Embracing Growth: Moving Beyond a Fixed Mindset

The crucial step of acknowledging where you currently stand is already behind you. Remember, your mindset isn't a life sentence; it can be changed and developed over time. This self-assessment is your first step towards cultivating a growth mindset and unlocking your full potential.
Understanding the Fixed Mindset
A fixed mindset, a term coined by psychologist Carol Dweck, is the belief that your intelligence, talents, and abilities are static. It can hinder your success in several ways:
Challenges Become Roadblocks: You may give up easily when faced with difficulties, fearing failure and avoiding risks or new experiences.
Success Becomes Envy: You might harbor resentment towards successful individuals, mistakenly attributing their achievements to luck or innate talent rather than effort and growth.
However, recognizing these traits means you're already on the path to change. A mindset isn't permanent; it's something you can evolve with awareness and determination.
Innovation and Creativity: A fixed mindset can stifle your innovative spirit, holding you back from exploring new strategies and thinking creatively. It's like having wings but being afraid to fly. That said, you can overcome this fear and unleash your potential by embracing a growth mindset.
Adaptability: In our fast-paced business world, adaptability is key. A fixed mindset can hinder your ability to respond to market changes and embrace new technologies. However, you have the power to learn and adapt - it's about willingness, not ability.
Learning and Growth: Viewing your abilities as unchangeable can limit your growth as a leader. Yet, challenges and setbacks aren't insurmountable obstacles; they're opportunities for learning and growth. Your mindset can be the bridge to your success, not the barrier.
Conclusion: Your Path to Growth
If you recognize a fixed mindset in yourself, take heart. It's a starting point, not an endpoint. Your intelligence, talents, and abilities aren't set in stone; they're waiting to be developed and expanded. Embrace the process of growth, and you'll find yourself not just surviving, but thriving in your business journey.
2: Harness the Power of ""Yet"": Reframing Limitations as Growth Opportunities
What is it?
In this step, you'll learn to see current limitations not as permanent barriers, but as temporary hurdles that can be overcome. This involves adopting the power of ""yet""—a mindset that acknowledges you may not have currently mastered a skill or achieved a goal, yet with effort and persistence, you can in the future.
Why is it important?
Embracing the power of ""yet"" is critical as it underpins a growth mindset. This perspective fuels resilience, motivation, and innovation, enabling you to approach challenges with confidence and optimism. It reframes perceived obstacles as opportunities for growth and development, which is a crucial shift for avoiding the stagnation associated with a fixed mindset.
Who should do it?
This practice is beneficial for everyone within an organization, from executives and managers to team members and individual contributors. Leaders, in particular, should model this mindset as it establishes a culture of continual learning and improvement, inspiring others to follow suit.
What is required?
All you need is self-awareness and the willingness to challenge personal perceptions of your abilities and potential.
Where should you do it?
The power of ""yet"" can be harnessed in both personal and professional settings. Integrate this mindset shift into leadership training, team meetings, personal development plans, or even daily mindfulness practices.
When should you do it?
Invoke the power of ""yet"" whenever you encounter a challenge or setback or when you set a goal that initially appears out of reach. This isn't a one-off exercise but rather an ongoing practice that needs to be reinforced regularly in order to embed a growth-oriented culture within your organization.
How do you embrace the power of “yet”?
Embracing the power of ""yet"" is not just a philosophy; it's a practice that can be woven into your daily life and mindset. Here's how you can do it:
1. Be Mindful of Thoughts and Language: Cultivate a positive internal dialogue that emphasizes growth and learning. Reframe thoughts and language to emphasize the excitement of growth and the journey rather than just the end goal. Instead of saying, ""I can't do this,"" say, ""I can't do this yet."" This small change in language opens up possibilities and relieves the pressure to be perfect.
2. Acknowledge Your Struggles: Pretending that challenges don't exist only makes them harder to overcome. Accept and acknowledge what you're struggling with, and open yourself to the possibility that you can conquer it. In business, your struggles are temporary, not permanent.
3. Be Patient with Yourself: Cultivate an understanding that achieving great things takes time. Change doesn't happen overnight. Keep practicing these strategies, and over time, you'll notice a shift in your mindset. Take time to understand what worked or didn't work. Reflecting on your actions, progress and evolution helps you adjust and grow.
Here are some practical examples of how you might apply this concept:
Striving to expand into new markets? Say, ""We haven't entered the market yet, but we're strategizing, building, and preparing.""
Working on product innovation? Say, ""We haven't finalized the product design yet, but we're making progress every day.""
Aiming to enhance team collaboration? Say, ""We haven't fully integrated our teams yet, but we're implementing new communication strategies.""
By incorporating these practices into your daily routine, you're not just adopting a positive outlook; you're actively cultivating a growth mindset. A growth mindset sees potential in every challenge and opportunity in every setback. Are you ready to embrace the power of ""yet""?
Quality Criteria:
The step is done correctly when:
A noticeable shift in attitude towards challenges and setbacks
Increased willingness to take on new challenges
Implementation of concrete strategies to achieve goals
Positive impact on team culture and overall organizational growth
Conclusion
Embracing the power of ""yet"" is a pivotal step in cultivating a growth mindset. It empowers you and your team to see challenges as opportunities for growth, fosters a culture of continuous learning, and sets the stage for innovation and success within your organization. By following these instructions, you lay the groundwork for a mindset that drives both personal development and organizational excellence.
3: Value the Process Over the Outcome
What
In this step, the emphasis shifts from merely achieving specific goals to deeply valuing the process that leads to those outcomes. This step encourages you to concentrate on the effort, strategy, and consistent progress made in reaching a goal, rather than fixating solely on the final results. It's a philosophy that recognizes that the journey itself holds intrinsic value, which fosters continuous learning and skill development. By honoring the process, you acknowledge that failure is not an end and is rather a stepping stone toward success, which can lead you to develop resilience and adaptability.
Why
Valuing the process over the outcome is an essential practice that cannot be overlooked. Here's why:
Learning Opportunity: The process is where the learning happens and allows you to identify what is working and what needs adjustment. By focusing on the journey, you enable continuous improvement and skill development.
Skill Enhancement: The process is where you hone your skills. As you practice and focus on the details, you become better and more proficient at what you are doing, leading to mastery.
Confidence Building: The process helps you build your confidence. By observing your progress and the incremental achievements, you foster self-belief and assurance in your abilities to reach your goals.
Anxiety Reduction: Focusing too much on the outcome can lead to stress and anxiety, particularly if goals are not met. By valuing the process, you can find pride and accomplishment in the journey itself, not just the end result.
Enjoyment of the Journey: The process is often more enjoyable than the destination. When you engage in the learning and growth that comes with the journey, you find joy and fulfillment, enhancing overall satisfaction.
Cultivating Resilience and Innovation: This approach recognizes that failure is not a dead-end but an opportunity to learn and grow. It encourages an environment where innovation, adaptability, and resilience can thrive and drive your business towards success.
By embracing the importance of the process over the outcome, you create a culture within your organization where learning is continuous, and setbacks are viewed as opportunities for growth. This perspective fosters a more resilient mindset, preparing your team to handle challenges with grace and agility. It's an approach that aligns with a growth mindset, positioning your product, team, and business to excel in an ever-changing and competitive market.
Who
This step involves the entire leadership team, management, employees, and any stakeholders who contribute to the strategy, decision-making, and execution of tasks within your business. Collaboration and alignment across these roles are crucial to effectively implement this step.
How
Set Challenging but Achievable Goals: Align goals with the growth mindset by making them both aspirational and attainable. This keeps motivation high while also grounding expectations in reality.
Example: If you're aiming to expand your business into a new market, set a goal that stretches your capabilities but is grounded in research and analysis. Instead of aiming to dominate the entire market in a year, target a specific segment where your products or services have proven appeal.
Break Down Large Goals into Smaller Tasks: Simplify complex goals into measurable progress. This makes the process more accessible and provides opportunities to celebrate along the way.
Example: If the goal is to increase customer satisfaction ratings by 25% over the next quarter, break this down into smaller tasks, such as improving response times, offering personalized services, or implementing a new feedback system.
Focus on the Journey, Not the Destination: Implement practices that recognize and reward effort, strategy, and incremental progress. Emphasize the importance of continuous learning and growth throughout the journey.
Example: If you're working on a long-term project like developing a new product, celebrate the milestones achieved along the way, such as completing the prototype, securing key partnerships, or hitting pre-sales targets, instead of only focusing on the final launch.
Celebrate Successes and Learn from Failures: Build a culture that acknowledges both small and significant achievements, and also views failures as learning opportunities rather than dead ends.
Example: If a new marketing strategy fails to reach the expected audience, rather than viewing it as a failure, analyze what went wrong and what was learned from the experience. Celebrate the insights gained and apply them to future initiatives.
Create a Feedback-Rich Environment: Foster open communication and feedback from colleagues, customers, and mentors. Use this feedback for continuous improvement and alignment with the growth mindset.
Example: Implement regular feedback sessions with team members, encouraging them to share their perspectives on projects and processes. Use customer feedback to enhance product features or services. Engage with mentors or industry experts to gain insights and perspectives that may not be available within the organization.
Quality Criteria
The step is done correctly when:
The team understands and embraces the concept of valuing process over outcome.
There is a noticeable shift in focus from merely achieving goals to learning, growing, and progressing.
Failures and setbacks are openly discussed and analyzed for learning opportunities.
Intermittent successes, efforts, and progress are regularly recognized and celebrated.
There is evidence of increased resilience, adaptability, and innovation within the team.
Conclusion
Valuing the process over the outcome is not just a change in perspective; it's a strategic shift that can drive your business towards greater innovation, resilience, and success. By focusing on effort, strategy, and progress, you foster a culture where continuous learning is the norm, and setbacks are opportunities for growth. Following this step will position your product, team, and business to thrive in a competitive and ever-changing market.
4: Reframe Challenges as Opportunities
What
Reframing challenges as opportunities involves shifting your perspective to view obstacles, setbacks, and criticisms as avenues for growth and improvement rather than barriers. This step requires a fundamental change in how you approach challenges, seeing them as opportunities to learn, innovate, and enhance your product, team, and business instead of as threats.
Why
The ability to reframe challenges as opportunities is vital because it fosters resilience, encourages risk-taking, and promotes a culture of continuous learning and innovation. This perspective can lead to more agile and responsive decision-making, which aligns with the growth mindset essential for business success. Without this step, you risk stifling creativity, innovation, and adaptability by cultivating a fear-based culture.
Who
This step involves everyone within the organization, from executive leadership to the management teams and individual contributors. Cultivating this mindset requires a collaborative effort, where everyone is encouraged to view challenges as opportunities for growth.
How
1. Create a Positive Precedent: Frame complex scenarios as opportunities from the beginning.
Start every project or challenge by framing it as an opportunity rather than a problem. This mindset shift encourages a positive and growth-oriented approach.
How:
Identify the Challenge: Clearly define the challenge you're facing and why it's seen as a problem.
Reframe the Challenge: Shift your language and mindset to view the challenge as an opportunity. Encourage your team to do the same.
Set Clear Goals: Establish clear and achievable goals that align with this opportunity-oriented perspective.
Monitor Progress: Regularly assess progress towards these goals, maintaining a positive and constructive approach.
Example: A company facing a significant drop in sales due to market changes may initially view this as a devastating problem. By framing this scenario as an opportunity to innovate and tap into new markets, the leadership sets a positive precedent. Instead of dwelling on the negative, the team focuses on exploring fresh strategies, like developing new products or entering emerging markets. This shift in perspective fosters a growth-oriented culture that embraces challenges.
2. Use Constructive Feedback as a Tool for Improvement: Embrace constructive feedback as a chance to grow and improve.

What: Treat constructive feedback not as an attack but as a valuable source of insight for personal and professional growth.
How:
Receive Constructive Feedback Gracefully: Listen to criticism without becoming defensive. Acknowledge the feedback and thank the giver.
Analyze the Feedback: Break down the criticism to identify specific areas for improvement.
Create an Action Plan: Develop a clear plan to address the areas identified, including timelines and milestones.
Foster a Feedback Culture: Encourage open and constructive feedback within your team, making it part of the regular workflow.

Example: An executive receives feedback that her communication style is sometimes perceived as abrupt, leading to misunderstandings within her team. Instead of dismissing this constructive feedback, she takes it as an opportunity to grow. She engages in communication training, seeks regular feedback from her team, and actively works on being more empathetic and clear in her interactions. By using constructive feedback as a tool for improvement, she enhances her leadership skills and fosters a more cohesive team environment.
3, Be Open to New Perspectives: Cultivate openness to new ideas and suggestions.
What: Encourage an environment where new ideas are welcomed and considered, fostering innovation and adaptability.
How:
Encourage Open Dialogue: Create spaces and opportunities for team members to share ideas and perspectives.
Evaluate Ideas Fairly: Assess new ideas on their merit, not their source. Create a systematic way to evaluate and prioritize suggestions.
Implement and Adapt: Be willing to experiment with promising ideas and adapt existing strategies based on new insights.
Celebrate Innovation: Recognize and reward creative thinking and successful implementation of new ideas.
Example: A tech startup is struggling to gain traction with its current product. Instead of clinging to their original vision, the leadership is open to new perspectives from the team. A junior developer suggests a pivot that aligns more closely with emerging industry trends. By being open to this new perspective, the company successfully pivots, leading to increased market relevance and growth.
These core actions create a holistic approach for entrepreneurs and executives to reframe challenges as opportunities. By creating a positive precedent, using constructive feedback for growth, and fostering openness to new ideas, leaders can build a culture that thrives on innovation, adaptability, and continuous improvement.
Quality Criteria:
The step is done correctly when:
Negative thoughts are identified, challenged, and replaced with constructive perspectives.
Opportunities for growth within challenges are recognized and emphasized.
Constructive feedback is actively used as a tool for improvement.
A culture of openness, collaboration, and continuous learning is evident.
Goals are clearly defined, broken down into manageable tasks, and aligned with the growth mindset.
A positive shift in mindset and approach to challenges is observable within the team.
By reframing challenges as opportunities and aligning with a growth mindset, you unlock the potential to drive innovation, resilience, and success within your organization. This approach not only transforms how your team navigates challenges, leading to enhanced product quality and team cohesion but also positions your business for enduring success in today's dynamic landscape. Continuous effort, self-awareness, and collaboration are essential to reap these rewards.
5. ACTIVITY: Journal on a Reflection of Your Mindset Shift
This activity offers a platform for you to chronicle your journey towards cultivating an growth mindset. It serves as a tool for reflection, allowing you to track your progress, confront your setbacks, and document your thoughts, feelings, and observations throughout this process.
What
The task involves maintaining a Mindset Shift Journal. This is a regular exercise where you chronicle your journey towards cultivating a growth mindset. By reflecting on specific prompts and analyzing your thoughts, feelings, and experiences, you document your progress towards personal and professional growth.
Why

It serves as a tangible tool to foster continuous learning, adaptation, and resilience, which are all essential qualities for thriving in today's business landscape. You'll find clarity in your decisions and actions and recognize areas for further development.
When
You should engage in this journaling task regularly, either daily or weekly. Setting a consistent schedule ensures that you maintain a regular habit of reflection. Additionally, a monthly review of your entries helps identify patterns, progress, and areas for improvement.
Where

Who
Primarily, this is an individual exercise, and you are the central participant. However, you may also engage a mentor, peer, or accountability partner to provide guidance, support, and encouragement in the process. This collaboration can further enrich your reflective experience.
How
1. Choose a Format

Decide on the medium for your journal. Perhaps you already have a journal and you’ll just add your mindset musings to it. Whether it's a physical notebook, digital document, or a dedicated app, it should align with your preferences and be easily accessible.
2. Set Clear Goals
Define specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for what you want to achieve with your growth mindset journal. These could include learning new skills, improving performance, or fostering positivity and resilience.
3. Track Thoughts and Beliefs

Regularly document your thoughts and beliefs about your abilities and growth potential. Challenge negative thinking and replace it with growth-oriented thoughts.
4. Create a Regular Schedule

Establish a consistent routine, such as daily or weekly entries, to maintain a habit of reflection.
5. Utilize Journal Prompts

Reflect on specific prompts that resonate with your growth mindset. For example, analyze your actions, decisions, obstacles, and learning experiences.
The step is done correctly when:
Am I being curious? Embracing curiosity promotes open-mindedness and fosters continuous learning and innovation. Regularly ask yourself, ""What am I missing here?"" and ""What assumptions am I making, and how can I challenge them?""
Am I being adaptable? Navigating the ever-evolving business landscape requires adaptability. Encourage flexibility by asking, ""How can I make this situation work to my advantage?"" and ""If I were to embrace this change, what opportunities might it present?""
Am I willing to take a calculated risk? A growth mindset entails embracing risk. Understanding potential rewards and learning opportunities, regardless of the outcome, is key. You might ask yourself, ""What is the potential reward if this risk pays off?"" and ""What can I learn from this situation, regardless of the outcome?""
Am I being forward-thinking? A forward-thinking perspective enables strategic decision-making and proactive action. Encourage this mindset by asking, ""What are the potential long-term effects of my decision?"" and ""How might future trends and changes in the market affect this situation?""
Am I collaborating effectively? Promoting teamwork and considering diverse perspectives drives collective growth and success. Foster collaboration by asking, ""Have I considered diverse perspectives in this scenario?"" and ""How can I foster more effective teamwork in this situation?"" If not, ask yourself how you can collaborate more effectively.
Am I demonstrating resilience? By learning from challenges and finding positive aspects in difficult situations, we foster a mindset of growth and resilience. Ask yourself, ""How can I grow from this challenge?"" and ""What is one positive thing I can take from this situation?""
Am I employing empathy? Understanding the needs and experiences of others is crucial for effective leadership and team management. Cultivate empathy by asking, ""How might others be feeling or thinking in this situation?"" and ""What can I do to better understand the needs and experiences of others?""
Am I problem-solving strategically? Strategic problem-solving promotes growth and development. Encourage this approach by asking, ""What is the root cause of this issue?"" and ""How can I approach this problem in a novel, creative way?""
Celebrate Successes: Acknowledge and celebrate all achievements, big or small. Reflect on what you and/or your team did well to reinforce positive behaviors.
Reflect on Challenges: Analyze challenges encountered and the lessons learned from them. Understand how you overcame them and how your mindset contributed to your growth.
Based on your answers to these questions, determine which traits require more development. These will form the focus of your action plan.
Remember, cultivating a growth mindset is an ongoing journey that demands persistence, self-awareness, and an unyielding commitment to learning. These principles lay the foundation for your personal and professional growth and set the stage for a culture of innovation within your organization. Remember, each challenge is an opportunity, every mistake a lesson, and every victory a testament to the power of a growth mindset. As you embrace this journey, you're not only transforming your career but also shaping the very essence of your outlook on business.

Resilience
In the fast-paced world of entrepreneurship and executive leadership, one quality often stands out as a key determinant of success: resilience. But what does it mean to be resilient? Is it merely the ability to withstand pressure, or does it encompass something more profound?
Resilience is about bouncing back while moving forward with purpose, vision, and an unwavering belief in oneself. It's about cultivating a mindset that embraces change as a catalyst for growth, sees failures as learning opportunities, and fuels a desire to make a positive impact.
Whether you're an aspiring entrepreneur, a seasoned executive, or anyone looking to take their career and life to the next level, this course is designed with you in mind. Resilience is a skill, a mindset, a lifestyle, and a vital part of your professional DNA. By embracing these four strategies, you'll not only navigate the challenging world of business but excel in it.
Are you ready to add resilience to your strengths? Let's embark on this exciting journey together.
Why You Need Resilience
You face challenges every day. A sudden market shift, a product failure, a critical decision that didn't pan out as expected. These aren't mere obstacles; they're opportunities, provided you have the resilience to see them as such.
Overcoming Setbacks: When things go wrong, it's not the end; it's a lesson. Resilient leaders don't dwell on failure. They analyze, learn, and move forward.
Managing Stress: Your role is demanding, but resilience helps you handle stress effectively, keeping you focused on your goals rather than the pressures.
Learning from Mistakes: Mistakes are inevitable. Resilient individuals don't shy away from them; they learn from them, transforming errors into enhancements.
Building Relationships: Trust, rapport, collaboration. Resilience enables you to forge strong connections with your team, clients, and stakeholders, strengthening your entire business ecosystem.
The impact of resilience goes beyond these aspects. It's a competitive advantage that keeps your business agile and sharp. Resilience is the unseen force that not only helps you stay on track but also fuels your growth, mental well-being, optimism, flexibility, and motivation. This quality guides you, your team, and your business through challenges with courage and conviction.
Resilience extends beyond your professional life, spilling over into your personal well-being to contribute to happiness, fulfillment, and a balanced life. Resilience is cultivated over time through experiences, reflections, and continuous learning, serving as an essential part of your leadership toolkit. Eventually, it becomes a lifestyle and philosophy that defines successful leaders.
1. Embracing Challenges: Transforming Obstacles into Opportunities for Growth
In the business world, challenges are unavoidable, but they don't have to be obstacles. This section will guide you through embracing challenges as opportunities, turning them into stepping stones for growth and leadership. Let's redefine success by turning inevitable difficulties into powerful tools for your business journey.
1.1 Accepting Challenges as Part of Success: A Guide
You know as well as anyone that the road to success is never a smooth one. Challenges? They're inevitable. But let's shift our perspective on what challenges really mean for you and your business.
Embrace the Inevitability of Challenges: Challenges aren't a sign of failure; they're a natural part of life and business. The sooner you accept this, the more empowered you'll be.
Break Challenges Down: A big challenge can seem overwhelming - break it down into smaller, manageable steps. Much like solving a complex puzzle. You'll be amazed at how achievable it becomes when you view one piece at a time.
Don't Hesitate to Ask for Help: Even the strongest leaders need support. If you're facing a tough challenge, reach out to a colleague or mentor. Asking for help is a sign of wisdom not weakness.
Celebrate Every Victory: Did you overcome a challenge? Take a moment to pat yourself on the back. The journey is equally as important as the end goal and acknowledging success can fuel motivation and build momentum.
Adopt a Growth Mindset: Challenges are not roadblocks; they're growth opportunities. Each one offers a chance to learn, improve, and grow. Reflect on what went wrong, what you could have done differently, and use that information to become better.
Stay Positive and Keep Moving Forward: Maintaining a positive attitude is your secret weapon. Focus on what you can control and keep your eyes on the prize. Don't let setbacks hold you back; they're just stepping stones on your path to success.
Remember, You're Not Alone: Everyone faces challenges. From the newest startup to the multinational corporation, challenges are a universal experience. They don't define you, but how you handle them does.
1.2 Turning Challenges into Triumphs: Your Guide to Positive Thinking
Challenges are inevitable. As an entrepreneur or executive, your reaction to these challenges can make all the difference. Here's a roadmap to help you focus on the positive, see opportunities in adversity, and ultimately drive success.
Reframe Your Perspective: Challenges aren't roadblocks; they're stepping stones. Instead of viewing them as hindrances, see them as opportunities for growth, learning, and acquiring new skills and insights along the way.
Focus on the Positive: When a challenge arises, it's natural to see the downside. Instead, shift your focus to what you can learn from the situation. How can it make you a better leader? How can it shape your future decisions? That positive focus fuels growth and innovation.
Acknowledge Your Feelings: Feelings of frustration or disappointment are natural. Acknowledge them, but don't dwell on them. Understanding your emotions can actually empower you to move forward with clarity and determination.
Seek the Silver Lining: Every challenge has hidden benefits. Maybe it's a lesson learned, a skill gained, or even a new connection made. Look for those small wins—they're the building blocks of long-term success.
Lean on Your Strengths: You have unique strengths. Use them. Whether it's your creativity, analytical ability, or leadership skills, focusing on what you do best can turn a challenging situation into a rewarding one.
Help Others: Sometimes, helping others through their challenges can provide insights into your own. It's not just altruistic; it's also strategic. It builds empathy, fosters teamwork, and strengthens your leadership.
Be Patient with Yourself: Healing and growth take time. Progress might be slow, but every step forward counts. Patience isn't just a virtue; it's a business strategy.
This approach isn't just about staying positive; it's about transforming the way you view and handle challenges. It leads to better decision-making, fosters a positive work culture, and builds resilience that's essential for long-term success.
Next time you face a challenge, remember you have the tools to turn it into an opportunity. Embrace the process, focus on the positive, and watch how it not only enhances your business but enriches your personal growth as a leader.
1.3 Resilience > Coping
In business, stress and challenges are inevitable. But there's a difference between merely coping with these challenges and truly growing from them. Let's explore how resilience, more than coping, is your key to evolving your business and achieving sustainable success.
Coping: A Temporary Solution
Coping is about handling immediate stress. It's your emergency toolkit for navigating the emotional turbulence of the moment. While coping strategies can provide short-term relief, they are not a long-term solution for growth and success.
Resilience: Your Long-Term Strategy for Growth
Resilience is where the real magic happens. It's not just about bouncing back; it's about growing, adapting, and thriving in the face of challenges. Resilience is your foundation for sustainable success. It empowers you to:
Learn from Setbacks: Every challenge becomes a lesson, driving continuous improvement.
Prepare for the Future: Resilience equips you to face upcoming challenges with confidence and foresight.
Foster a Positive Culture: Instilling resilience within your team fosters a culture of innovation, collaboration, and growth.
Why Choose Resilience Over Mere Coping?
Sustainability: While coping offers temporary relief, resilience builds lasting strength and adaptability.
Growth Mindset: Resilience encourages learning and growth, turning challenges into opportunities.
Alignment with Business Evolution: In a constantly changing business environment, resilience aligns with your goals of growth, innovation and continuous evolution.
Coping is a short-term response, but resilience is your long-term strategy. It's the driving force that allows you and your team to not only survive but thrive, to not only react but evolve.
Your career and business deserve more than temporary solutions. Embrace resilience as your pathway to sustainable growth and success.
2. Building Resilience Through Learning
Success isn't about perfection but growth. In your journey, mistakes are not mere setbacks but invaluable opportunities, and the wisdom of others isn't just inspiration; it's guidance. This section is designed to transform your approach to failure and leverage the experiences of others, fostering resilience and innovation in your career, team, and business.
2.1 Learning from Mistakes: Your Guide to Growth and Success
Mistakes happen. Whether you're launching a new product or leading a team, there will be moments when things don't go as planned. Let's explore how you can turn setbacks into opportunities.
Acknowledge the Mistake: While it's tough to admit when you've gone wrong, being honest with yourself is the gateway to growth. It's not about self-criticism; it's about self-awareness. Recognize the mistake, and you're already on the path to learning.
Understand the “Why”: Dig in - what led to the mistake? Was it a lack of information, a misguided strategy, or something else? Understanding why a mistake occurred helps you pinpoint what needs to change.
Identify the Lessons: Every mistake holds a lesson. Maybe it's a new skill you need to develop or a different approach you need to take. These lessons provide valuable wisdom that shapes your future decisions.
Make a Plan: You've identified the lessons; now it's time to create a plan to ensure you don't repeat the mistake. Commit to taking a proactive step towards continuous improvement, such as changing a habit, seeking professional development, or collaborating with your team.
Forgive Yourself: Remember, every great entrepreneur and executive has made mistakes. It's human. What sets you apart is how you respond. Forgive yourself, move on, and let the experience sharpen rather than define you.
In business, the ability to learn from mistakes is not just a trait; it's a strategy. It fosters resilience, encourages innovation, and builds a culture of continuous learning within your team. The next time a mistake happens, don't shy away. Embrace setbacks as an opportunity to learn, grow, and excel. After all,your response to mistakes is what defines your trajectory.
2.2 Learning from Others' Experiences: Accelerating Your Resilience
Imagine having a treasure trove of wisdom at your fingertips, filled with lessons learned, pitfalls avoided, and success stories. That's exactly what you can have when you tap into the experiences, failures, and successes of fellow entrepreneurs and executives. Here's how you can make their journeys part of your road to resilience.
Learn from Both Sides of the Coin: Successes and Failures
Learn from Others: Don't just admire the success stories; dive into the challenges, mistakes, and setbacks that others have faced. There's valuable insight in both triumphs and tribulations.
Read Widely: Biographies and autobiographies offer intimate, inspirational and instructional glimpses into the lives of successful individuals.
Engage with Multimedia: Podcasts, interviews, and videos bring the voices and visions of experienced entrepreneurs right to you.
Connect and Collaborate: Networking with Purpose
Attend Conferences and Workshops: These events put you in the same room with those who've walked the path you're on. Listen, learn, and don't be shy to ask questions.
Build Your Network: Engage with peers and industry leaders. Their experiences can become your lessons. Share your challenges too; mutual growth is a two-way street.
Seek and Apply Feedback: The Mirror to Your Work
Embrace Honest Opinions: Encourage those you trust to provide candid feedback on your business. Their perspectives might unveil blind spots or opportunities.
Reflect Regularly: Take time to review your work and business. Identify your wins and areas for improvement. Self-awareness is a cornerstone of growth.
The Benefits to Your Career, Team, and Business
Accelerated Learning Curve: By learning from others, you can sidestep pitfalls and adopt proven strategies, saving time and resources.
Enhanced Decision Making: Insights from various experiences equip you with a broader perspective, enriching your decision-making process.
Cultivating a Culture of Growth: Encouraging your team to learn from others fosters a culture of continuous learning and innovation.
You don't have to walk the road alone or learn everything the hard way. Gaining insights from others' experiences is like having one of the most powerful accelerators available in the world of entrepreneurship and executive leadership. It guides you, warns you, and inspires you. Every conversation, book, and connection is a stepping stone towards a more insightful and resilient you. Engage with the collective wisdom, learn from it, let it shape your journey towards greater resilience and success and watch how it transforms not just you, but your entire team and business. 
3. Self-Care Builds Resilience
Welcome to a journey that transcends the conventional realms of leadership. In a world where adaptability, vision, and self-care are paramount, your role extends beyond mere decision-making. This section will encourage you to take care of yourself, cultivate a vision beyond immediate goals, and embrace change as an opportunity, enhancing your leadership and paving the way for sustainable growth.
3.1 Prioritizing Self-Care and Mindfulness
As a business leader your ability to lead, innovate, and grow doesn't just depend on your business acumen but on a balanced and resilient you. Here's how you can blend self-care and mindfulness into your leadership approach:
Physical Health: Your Body's Role in Business Success
Diet: Fueling your body with nutritious foods isn't just a health choice; it's a business decision. The energy and clarity from a balanced diet can empower you to lead effectively.
Exercise: Regular physical activity isn't merely a routine; it's a resilience-building practice that enhances your leadership and decision-making abilities.
Rest: Sleep is not downtime; it's a critical part of your leadership toolkit. It rejuvenates your mind and body, preparing you for the challenges ahead.
Mental Wellness: The Mind Behind the Leader
Emotional Awareness: Understanding your thoughts and feelings isn't self-indulgence; it's strategic self-awareness. It helps you navigate complex business landscapes with empathy and insight.
Professional Support: Seeking professional mental health support when needed isn't a sign of weakness; it's a strength that fortifies your leadership.
Joyful Activities: Engaging in activities that bring you joy isn't a distraction; it's a vital part of keeping you grounded and focused.
Mindfulness and Stress Management: The Leader's Inner Compass
Mindfulness Practices: Engaging in mindfulness techniques like meditation or deep breathing isn't a trendy habit; it's a method to enhance focus and calmness in decision-making.
Nature and Connection: Spending time in nature or with loved ones isn't just relaxation; it's a way to reconnect with what matters, helping you build empathy and enriching your leadership perspective.
Self-Care Rituals: Investing time in self-care isn't a luxury; it's a necessity that builds resilience and sustains long-term success.
The Impact on Your Leadership
Enhanced Decision Making: A well-cared-for mind and body lead to clear and effective decisions.
Positive Influence on Team: Your well-being sets a positive example and creates a supportive work environment.
Sustainable Success: Building resilience through self-care ensures you are prepared for the long haul, leading your business to sustainable growth.
Your leadership journey is a marathon, not a sprint. It requires a resilient, well-balanced you at the helm. By integrating self-care and mindfulness into your leadership approach, you're not just investing in yourself; you're investing in the very core of your business success. Make this a priority, and you'll find that the benefits reach far beyond personal well-being and will lead to a thriving life, career, team, and business.
3.2 Cultivating a Vision Beyond Yourself
As a leader, it's all too easy to become absorbed in the day-to-day challenges and lose sight of the bigger picture. But what if you could anchor yourself to something greater, something that transcends the immediate needs of your business and taps into a profound sense of purpose? That's where crafting a vision that's bigger than yourself comes into play.
What Does it Mean to Have a Vision Bigger Than Yourself?
It's about aligning your goals with something that reaches beyond your personal desires and ambitions. This vision might be about contributing to society, creating lasting value, or driving positive change. It's a guiding star that can inspire you, motivate your team, and resonate with your customers.
How to Develop Your Vision
Here's a step-by-step approach to help you craft a vision that goes beyond yourself:
Reflect on Your Values and Passions: Identify what truly matters to you. What are the core beliefs that drive your decisions? What do you feel passionate about?
Envision the Impact: Think about the change you want to see in the world. How can your business contribute to that change?
Set Bold Goals: Dream big! Your vision should inspire and challenge you. It's about reaching for something exceptional.
Share and Collaborate: Engage your team, your partners, and your community in your vision. Find others who share your passion and can contribute to the journey.
Stay Positive and Persistent: Embrace optimism and don't lose sight of your vision, even when facing challenges. Persistence pays off.
Seek Inspiration and Support: Learn from mentors, read about those who've made a difference, and join communities aligned with your vision. Surround yourself with inspiration.
The Benefits of a Larger Vision
Your vision is more than a statement on a wall; it's a living, breathing philosophy that guides your every step. Having a vision that's bigger than yourself offers more than mere motivation. It provides direction, builds resilience, and creates a sense of fulfillment that transcends the ordinary. A broad vision can transform your business into a force for good, foster a committed team, and establish a legacy that endures. By embracing a vision that's bigger than yourself, you not only elevate your business but also contribute to something greater.
Take the time to reflect, envision, and act on this broader perspective. The journey may challenge you, but the rewards, both personal and professional, will be immeasurable.
3.3 Setting Goals and Staying Adaptable
As a driven professional, you understand the importance of setting targets and working diligently towards them. When the unexpected twists and turns inevitably arise in any business environment, you’ll need to set realistic goals and remain adaptable without losing sight of your vision. Let's explore some strategies to help you stay resilient:
Define Clear and Achievable Goals
Be Specific and Realistic: Outline what you aim to achieve, the steps to get there, and the timeframe. Ensure that these goals are challenging yet within reach.
Break It Down: Divide your overarching goals into smaller, digestible tasks. This approach makes your journey less intimidating and promotes regular progress.
Stay Flexible: Recognize that changes are part of the process. Be willing to adapt and modify your goals if circumstances demand.
Celebrate Success and Learn from Setbacks
Appreciate Achievements: Every accomplishment, no matter how small, deserves recognition. Reflect on what you've done well and the lessons learned.
Share and Reward: Don’t hesitate to share successes with your team and reward yourself. Acknowledging achievements fuels motivation.
Learn from Mistakes: If things don't go as planned, don’t dwell on the setback. Instead, analyze what went wrong and use it as a learning experience.
Foster a Positive and Patient Approach
Avoid Unnecessary Comparisons: Your journey is unique. Find a balance in learning from others. Focusing on your path rather than comparing with others keeps you centered on your objectives.
Patience Pays Off: Achieving great things takes time. Maintain your determination, and don't be disheartened if results are not immediate.
Seek Support When Needed: There's no shame in asking for assistance. A fresh perspective from friends, family, or professionals can be invaluable.
Why Is This Approach Vital for You?
Enhanced Performance: Realistic goal-setting promotes success without unnecessary stress. It allows you to perform at your best without feeling overwhelmed.
Increased Satisfaction: Celebrating achievements enhances personal satisfaction and professional fulfillment.
Robust Resilience: This balanced approach helps you build resilience, enabling you to navigate challenges and continue moving forward, no matter what comes your way.

While your goals are your roadmap, adaptability is the vehicle that allows you to navigate the dynamic landscape of modern business. Stay focused, stay flexible, and success will follow.

Cultivate an Open Mindset

By embracing change as an opportunity, you not only pave the way for personal growth but foster an environment where your team and business can flourish.The next time you find yourself at the crossroads of change, remember, it's not a roadblock but a launching pad. Adapt, innovate, and thrive.
4. Strengthening the Foundations of Resilience
4.1. Creating Your Circle of Success: Building a Robust Support System
In the fast-paced world of business, where challenges are a daily occurrence, a robust support system is more than just comforting—it's a necessity. As a seasoned executive or budding entrepreneur, your success often hinges on your ability to navigate through the ups and downs. Here's how to construct a network that empowers you and promotes resilience:
Identify Your Support System
Find the Champions in Your Life: Who are the people that genuinely believe in you and your vision? They could be friends, family, mentors, or colleagues.
Embrace Their Support: Regularly connect with these individuals, whether in person, on the phone, or online. Their encouragement and advice can be your guiding light.
Cultivate New Connections
Be Open to New Relationships: Attend networking events, join relevant groups, and be active in communities where like-minded people gather.
Seek Quality Over Quantity: Focus on building meaningful relationships that align with your values and interests.
Be Patient in Building Relationships: Strong, supportive relationships don’t develop overnight. Invest time and effort, and the right people will come into your life.
Be a Supportive Influence
Offer Help and Encouragement: In the world of business, what goes around comes around. Being supportive of others not only fosters a positive environment but also strengthens your own network.
Communicate Your Needs
Express What You Need: Whether it's a listening ear, specific advice, or a challenge you need help overcoming, let those in your support system know how they can best assist you.
Why This Matters to You and Your Business:
Enhanced Happiness and Fulfillment: Supportive relationships lead to a stronger sense of belonging and personal satisfaction.
Increased Chances of Success: With the right advice, encouragement, and practical help, you’re more likely to overcome obstacles and reach your goals.
Strengthened Resilience: In tough times, a robust support system helps you bounce back and continue moving forward.
Surrounding yourself with a network of supportive and constructive friends, family, and mentors isn't just about personal well-being; it's a strategic move that directly impacts your professional growth. By following these guidelines, you can build a circle of success that will be there for you when you need it most, fueling your ambition and helping you achieve your business dreams. Remember, you're not alone on this journey; make sure you have the right people beside you.
4.2 Balancing Confidence and Humility: A Pathway to Resilience
As a driven entrepreneur or seasoned executive, you're intimately familiar with the pursuit of success. The delicate balance between confidence and humility stands as your secret weapon. Confidence fuels your ambition, propels you forward, and ignites the fire of determination. On the other hand, humility ensures you stay grounded, receptive to feedback, and are continually learning.
Steer clear of constantly lamenting setbacks or excessively boasting about triumphs. Instead, harness the synergy of confidence and humility. This combination is more than just a theoretical balance; it's a practical, powerful blend that fortifies resilience and paves the way to enduring success.
Here's how you can master this dynamic duo in your professional life:
Recognize Your Strengths and Weaknesses
Identify What You Excel In: Know your areas of expertise and where you shine.
Acknowledge Where You Can Improve: Understanding your limitations is an opportunity to grow.
Cultivate Respect and Openness
Respect Others' Ideas: Even when you disagree, listening to different perspectives can enrich your own understanding.
Stay Open to Feedback: Constructive criticism is a growth opportunity. Embrace it.
Embrace Humility and Gratitude
Maintain a Humble Approach: Confidence doesn't mean arrogance. Recognize your capabilities without overlooking others' contributions or overstating your own significance.
Cultivate Gratitude: Appreciate what you have and who you are, keeping you anchored and centered.
Allow Time for Growth
Be Patient with Yourself: Building resilience and striking this balance takes time. Keep working on it, and you'll see the transformation.
Why This Matters to You and Your Business
Enhanced Career Success: A confident yet humble leader often garners respect and opportunities for advancement.
Stronger Relationships: Trust and meaningful connections flourish when you show genuine interest and respect for others.
Personal Fulfillment: Finding joy in your accomplishments while appreciating life's gifts leads to a more balanced and fulfilling life.
Dismissal of Others' Ideas: Executives who are not humble may dismiss or belittle the ideas and contributions of their team. This can lead to a lack of innovation and creativity, as team members may feel discouraged from sharing their thoughts.
Resistance to Feedback: A lack of humility often accompanies resistance to feedback. Executives who believe they already have all the answers are less likely to seek or accept input from others. This can hinder growth and adaptation, as they may miss out on valuable insights and opportunities for improvement.
Creation of a Toxic Environment: Arrogance and a lack of respect for others can create a toxic work environment. Team members may feel undervalued, leading to low morale, decreased productivity, and even attrition.
Jeopardizing Relationships and Success: An executive's lack of confidence or humility may drive away support from colleagues, partners, and employees. The erosion of these essential relationships can undermine both personal career advancement and the overall success of the organization.
Real-Life Applications
In Negotiations: Confidence paired with humility enables you to assert your position while considering others' viewpoints.
In Leadership: Leading with empathy and assurance promotes a more cohesive and motivated team.
In Personal Development: Growth is fostered through continual self-awareness and appreciation for others' roles in your success.
In conclusion, blending confidence with humility isn't about diluting your strength; it's about enriching your leadership and personal life. This equilibrium helps you navigate the complex world of business with grace and resilience. Remember, your success isn't just about what you achieve; it's also about how you achieve it. By embracing this balance, you're not only building a resilient mindset but also shaping a career and life filled with respect, growth, and fulfillment.
4.3 Resilience in the Company of Negative People
In the journey toward success, you'll inevitably encounter nay-sayers—those individuals who seem to have a knack for discouraging ideas or casting doubt on your abilities. While their words may be disheartening, it's essential to recognize that their opinions don't define your potential. Here's how you can navigate past the negativity and focus on building your skills:
Identify and Set Boundaries with Nay-Sayers
Recognize the individuals who consistently emit negativity, and, if possible, limit your interactions with them. If you must engage with them, set clear boundaries by avoiding discussions that spiral into negativity.
Surround Yourself with Positivity
Build a support network of friends, colleagues, and mentors who believe in you. Their encouragement, alongside constructive feedback, can be invaluable fuel for your drive toward success.
Believe in Yourself
Trust in your abilities and maintain your focus on your goals. The path to success is often laden with challenges, but your belief in yourself is a powerful tool that can keep you moving forward.
Embrace Self-Care
In the face of adversity, adequate sleep, proper nutrition, and regular exercise will keep you energized and resilient. Take the time to nourish your physical and mental well-being.
Use Negativity as Motivation
If you encounter resistance or skepticism, let it motivate rather than discourage you. Transform the negativity into a driving force that propels you toward your goals.
Focus on Continuous Learning
Examine negative feedback through the lens of improvement. Continue to invest in your personal and professional development by seeking new opportunities, attending workshops, and continually honing your skills.
Your journey to success is uniquely yours, and while others may cast doubts or criticism, remember that your determination, focus, and resilience are the true determinants of your achievement. By following these strategies, you can steer clear of nay-sayers and concentrate on what truly matters: your growth, your goals, and your success.
By embracing these principles, not only will you bolster your resilience, but you'll create an environment where your career, team, and business can thrive. Let the positivity of your vision and the strength of your determination guide you, and success will follow.

“Learn continually - there's always ‘one more thing’ to learn!” 
- Steve Jobs
Welcome to the journey of continuous learning—a journey tailored for you, the entrepreneur and executive seeking to thrive in today's dynamic business landscape.
In the realm of business, change is the only constant. Your ability to adapt, evolve, and innovate is not a luxury; it's a necessity. As you navigate the challenges and opportunities that come with leadership, continuous learning becomes your compass, guiding you towards success. But what exactly does continuous learning mean, and why is it so crucial for you and your organization?
Continuous Learning Defined
Continuous learning is the ongoing pursuit of knowledge, skills, and expertise. It's about recognizing that the learning process never truly ends; there's always something new to discover, understand, or master. This principle applies to you as an individual leader and extends to your team, where fostering a culture of learning can unlock untold potential.
Why Continuous Learning Matters
In a world where technology evolves, markets shift, and customer needs change, standing still is akin to moving backward. Continuous learning equips you with the insights and agility to stay ahead of these changes. It's your tool to enhance leadership, catalyze innovation, and drive growth.
Evolving with Your Customers
Understanding your customers' ever-changing needs is a critical aspect of maintaining relevance in the marketplace. Continuously learning about these shifts ensures that your product or service always aligns with what your customers want and need. Stay in tune with them, and they'll stay connected to your business.
Staying Ahead in a Rapidly Changing World
In an environment where technology shifts and competition intensifies every day, continuous learning is your tool for staying ahead. By adapting to new advancements and understanding the evolving landscape, you position your business as an innovator and leader. It's about being proactive, not reactive.
Seizing Opportunities in a Transforming Market
The market is constantly transforming, and new opportunities emerge all the time. Continuously learning about these dynamics gives you the advantage to recognize and act on these opportunities when they arise. Knowledge is power, and in this context, it's the power to outpace competitors and capitalize on new possibilities.
The Impact on Your Business: Turning Learning into Growth
But what does continuous learning mean for your business? It's more than personal growth; it's about empowering your team and transforming your organization.
Accelerates Adaptation: Equip your team with the tools to adapt quickly to new technologies, practices, and industry developments. The smoother the transition, the less disruption to productivity. You become an agile, responsive force in your industry.
Stops Stagnation: A stagnant workforce is a business's downfall. Continual learning keeps you and your team on the cutting edge, pushing your business forward. Remain at the forefront, never falling into the traps of complacency.
Enables Skills Sharing: Create an open environment that fosters knowledge sharing. From best practices to lessons learned, this collaborative culture develops the skills your team needs to succeed. It's about growing together.
Creates Career Progression Opportunities: Investing in continuous learning shapes yourself and your team for future roles within your organization. It's a win-win, saving you resources and building a loyal, skilled workforce.
Continuous learning is not a trend; it's a strategic move towards success. It's about you, your team, and your business growing in unison, adapting to change, and leading in your industry.
As we embark on this exploration together, remember that continuous learning is more than a concept; it's a mindset, a habit, and a commitment to excellence. Let's dive in and unlock the transformative power of continuous learning for your career, your team, and your business.

Set Clear Goals: Align Learning with Your Vision and Strategy
Aligning learning with your vision and strategy is not just beneficial; it's essential. Whether you're an entrepreneur scaling a startup or an executive driving innovation in a corporation, setting clear and focused learning goals helps you stay ahead of the curve. This goes beyond merely listing subjects you want to learn about; it involves integrating learning into your business strategy, personal growth, and even team development. Here’s how you can tailor your learning objectives to your unique professional context:
Define Learning Objectives:
Identify Skill Gaps: Analyze your current skills and identify areas that need improvement to align with your business growth and leadership development.

Personal Growth Alignment: Consider personal development goals that enhance your leadership, communication, or strategic thinking.
Practice What You Learn: Apply new knowledge or skills to your daily work. This not only reinforces understanding but also shows immediate value.
Share Your Knowledge: If possible, share what you've learned with your team or network. It reinforces your understanding and builds a culture of learning.
Create a Learning Roadmap:
Break It Down: Divide your learning goals into manageable milestones. What will you learn in the next week, month, quarter?
Set Timelines: Assign specific timelines to each milestone to keep yourself accountable.
Incorporate Different Learning Methods: Plan to use various resources like books, articles, blogs, podcasts, online courses, workshops, or peer interactions to make learning multifaceted.
Track and Evaluate Progress
Regular Monitoring: Set up periodic reviews (weekly, monthly) to assess what you’ve learned and what needs adjustment.
Feedback Mechanism: If possible, get feedback from mentors, peers, or team members to understand how your new skills are translating into real-world performance.
Adjust as Needed: Be flexible. If something isn’t working or if business needs change, be ready to adapt your learning plan.
Setting clear and aligned learning goals is a strategic exercise that requires thoughtful consideration of your professional needs, business objectives, personal growth, and team development (if applicable). By defining specific objectives, creating a structured learning roadmap, aligning with organizational goals, tracking progress, and integrating learning into daily routines, you lay the foundation for a successful and impactful learning journey. This systematic approach ensures that learning is not an afterthought but a vital part of your business strategy and leadership development.
Make Learning Engaging and Rewarding: Tailor It to Your Needs

Connecting your hobby with your business needs makes the learning process feel less like a chore and more like an adventure.

Investing time wisely in learning is a strategic commitment. Identifying and adhering to a learning schedule that aligns with your energy, focus, and goals can greatly enhance your productivity. This section will guide you in creating a tailored learning routine, turning the act of learning into a fruitful and rewarding habit.
1. Assess Your Personal Rhythm
Schedule Learning: Dedicate specific hours each week. Consistency turns learning into a habit.
Consider Your Energy Levels: Understanding your natural energy flow allows you to align your learning with your most productive times. Are you a morning person or an evening person? Pinpoint when you feel most alert and focused.
Minimize Distractions: Identify potential interruptions and find a learning window that minimizes them. Control what you can and plan around what you cannot.
2. Align Learning with Your Goals 
Your learning schedule should reflect your specific objectives, whether it's preparing for a critical business meeting or exploring new strategic insights.
Balance with Business Needs: Learning is an investment. Ensure it complements, not competes with, your core business activities.
Consider Your Goals: What is the purpose behind your learning? Align your learning time with your overarching professional goals.
Consider Your Learning Style: Match the timing, content, and method of learning with your preferred learning style, whether it's reading, watching videos, or hands-on practice.

Where: Crafting Your Personalized Learning Space
Your learning environment can significantly influence your ability to focus, comprehend, and retain information. Creating a space that aligns with your learning needs is like setting the stage for your growth journey. Here's a tailored guide to help you craft your ideal learning space. 
1. Choose Your Space: A Harmonious Balance of Comfort and Functionality 
Select a Quiet Area: Look for spaces free from interruptions and noise. Libraries, private offices, or even a quiet corner at home can serve as perfect spots.
Light It Well: Ensure your chosen space is well-lit to avoid eye strain. Natural light is ideal, but a good lamp or overhead light can also suffice.
Embrace Room to Move: Space to stretch or move around keeps you energized and focused. It's essential for those longer learning sessions.
Personalize: Make it yours with plants, pictures, or any elements that foster a sense of comfort. Your space should inspire and resonate with you.
2. Eliminate Distractions: A Focused Mind Thrives
Turn Off Interruptions: Your phone, extra computer tabs, or background noise can be barriers to concentration. Minimize or eliminate these disruptions.
Create Dedicated Learning Spaces: If possible, designate a specific area in your home or office solely for learning. Consistency in location can reinforce your learning routine.
3. Experiment and Adapt: Your Space Should Evolve with You
Try Different Locations: Don't hesitate to experiment with various locations. What works for one subject or project may differ for another.
Adjust as Needed: Your learning needs and preferences may change over time. Regularly assess your space and make necessary adjustments to keep it aligned with your evolving goals.
Your Space, Your Success
Crafting the ideal learning environment is a strategic investment in your personal and professional development.

Applying these principles to your learning space ensures that every moment spent on personal growth is optimized for success. Whether it's a quiet home office or a bustling café that sparks your creativity, find what works for you, and let your environment be a catalyst for your continuous learning journey.

3. Utilize Tools and Connections to Find the Right People to Follow

Unfollow When Necessary: It's okay to unfollow accounts that no longer align with your interests or add value to your learning. Keep your feed focused on what matters most to you and your business.
Create Lists or Segments: Consider organizing your follows into lists or segments based on themes, industries, or roles. This organization can help you navigate your feed more efficiently, allowing you to focus on specific topics when needed.
Balance Quality and Quantity: While it's tempting to follow a large number of accounts, quality trumps quantity. Focus on following voices that consistently provide insights, perspectives, and information that serve your professional development.
Monitor Your Time: Be mindful of the time you spend on social media. While it's a valuable learning tool, it should complement—not replace—other professional growth activities. Consider setting time limits or scheduling specific times for social media exploration.
Engage with Content: Don't just consume; interact. Engaging with posts through comments, shares, or likes not only enhances your learning but also fosters connections with like-minded professionals.
By curating your social media feed wisely, you transform it into a dynamic learning environment, tailored to your specific needs and goals. It becomes a tool for growth, innovation, and connection, reflecting your commitment to continuous improvement and success in the ever-changing business landscape.

Creating a Data-Driven Culture
An astonishing 83% of CEOs express a desire to create a data-driven organization.

Enter this masterclass. Here, you'll gain the essential knowledge and strategies to shape a truly data-driven culture. Imagine an environment where insights spark decisive actions, strategies are pinpoint accurate, and every individual plays a part in growing and optimizing the company.
1. What is a Data-Driven Culture?
A data-driven culture is a collaborative environment where every decision is anchored in reliable and accessible data. It's where everyone, from the newest recruit to top-tier leadership, understands the value of data and uses it to make informed decisions, optimize operations, and drive innovation.
Key Characteristics of a Data-Driven Culture:
Data Accessibility: Everyone has access to the data they need. Think of it as an open library filled with valuable insights, just waiting for you to explore.
Training and Expertise: Your team isn't just data-aware; they're data-savvy. Through continuous training, they know how to gather, interpret, and implement findings from the data.
Decision-Making Powered by Data: Gone are the days of decisions based purely on intuition. Here, data shapes strategy, ensuring you're always on the right path.
Continuous Learning: In a data-driven culture, learning never stops. Every mistake is a lesson, every success a benchmark, and every piece of data a new opportunity to grow.
Why does this matter to you? A data-driven culture translates to improved efficiency, profitability, and a competitive edge. It's about more than numbers; it's about leveraging those numbers to foster teamwork, refine decision-making, and ultimately, enhance the value your business delivers.
2. Why is a Data-Driven Culture Important?
Embracing a data-driven culture is pivotal for entrepreneurs and executives aiming to elevate their business. By anchoring decisions in data, organizations not only enhance efficiency and profitability but also ensure informed choices that drive optimal outcomes. 
Better Decision-Making: A data-driven culture enables your team to make decisions that resonate with your company's ambitions. When your team can access and interpret real-time data, decisions become quicker, more informed, and better aligned with your business goals, customer needs and market realities.
Improve Efficiency: Starting a data-driven culture does come with costs, but it's a strategic investment. The rewards? Enhanced operations, minimized redundancies, and a clearer path to growth.
Increase Innovation: By providing your team the power to explore data, you're fostering an environment where fresh ideas emerge. Whether it's refining a product feature or crafting a new marketing strategy, insights from data are often the catalyst for innovation.
Enhance Cross-Functional Collaboration: When data flows freely, silos break down. This seamless sharing means your teams can work hand in hand, leveraging shared insights and fortifying company alignment and action.
Motivate Teams: Handing your team the keys to data isn't just about access; it's about empowerment. Motivation and productivity often soar when employees can use data to measure how their contributions fit within the broader business picture.
Clearly Define Goals: With a foundation built on data, setting relevant and precise KPIs becomes second nature. This clarity ensures every member, from leadership to interns, works with a unified purpose.
Accelerate Decision Making: Ensuring the accuracy and consistency of your data is essential. When you and your team trust the data, confidence and speed in decision-making naturally follows.
The journey towards developing and maintaining a data driven culture goes beyond embracing a trend - it's a commitment to a vision where every decision is backed by data, every strategy is meticulously crafted with insights, and every innovation is grounded in real-time feedback. By empowering your organization with data, you're not only meeting the expectations of modern business but also paving a path for unprecedented growth and success in a dynamic market.
3. Principles for Building a Data-Driven Culture
The true challenge lies in cultivating an organizational culture where data is both appreciated and integral to every decision made. As you delve into the principles outlined below, you'll discover actionable insights to help you overcome the cultural challenges while transforming your business into a data-centric powerhouse.
Lead By Example 
For any organizational change to take root, leaders must champion it. In cultivating a data-driven culture, it's imperative for leadership to lead by example. This means that every decision they make should visibly rely on data. When team members see leadership prioritizing data in their decision-making processes, they recognize its importance and are more likely to incorporate data into their own roles. By consistently and demonstrably anchoring decisions in data, leaders create an environment where data-driven choices become second nature.
Example: When launching a new product, the CEO of a tech startup used customer behavior data to determine its potential success and shared the findings during a company-wide presentation. Employees saw firsthand the CEO's commitment to data-driven decision-making.
Metrics Matter
Metrics are the yardstick by which businesses measure success. The metrics you adopt are able to guide behavior and shape the direction in which your business moves. It's essential to ensure that these metrics resonate with your business objectives. By selecting and clearly communicating the right metrics, you ensure everyone is aligned, pushing towards common goals. 
Example: A leading e-commerce company prioritized 'customer retention rate' as a metric. This aligned teams towards enhancing user experience, leading to increased repeat purchases.
Integrating Data Analysis with Business
Team members that understand their data hold invaluable insights. If your data and/or your teams are siloed and isolated from each other and the rest of the business, insightful data can go untapped. By fostering collaboration and the sharing of insights between team members and other business units, you facilitate a two-way exchange of knowledge, thereby ensuring that data-driven insights are applied effectively across the organization, maximizing their impact.
Example: At a financial firm, data scientists collaborated with the marketing team to analyze customer demographics. This resulted in tailored marketing campaigns with a 20% higher success rate.
Making Data Accessible
Having a wealth of data is of little use if it's not accessible. Addressing data access issues promptly ensures that teams have the information they need when they need it. By starting with essential datasets and gradually broadening access, you ensure a controlled yet progressive approach to data dissemination.
Example: An online retailer made sales data available to all departments. With direct access to real time sales and marketing data, the merchandising team could quickly identify and restock fast-selling items thereby improving revenue.
Embracing Uncertainty
Data analysis often comes with uncertainties. Instead of shying away from them, it's important to train your team to understand and quantify these uncertainties. This not only deepens you and your team’s understanding of data models but also prepares you both to make informed decisions, even when things aren't black and white.
Example: ""Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you're probably being slow."" - Jeff Bezos, Founder of Amazon and Blue Origin. 
Prioritizing Practicality
In the realm of data, it's easy to get lost in intriguing but complex projects. However, it's essential to prioritize scalable projects that are straightforward to implement. This ensures that your data initiatives deliver tangible benefits quickly, fostering a culture of practical data application.
Example: A logistics company focused on implementing a simple data-driven route optimization tool. This resulted in immediate savings in fuel costs and quicker deliveries which, in turn, helped secure more organizational support for the transition to a data-driven culture. 
Tailored Training
Training is more effective when it's relevant. Offering specialized training when it's immediately applicable ensures that team members can quickly apply what they've learned, reinforcing the training's value and ensuring its retention
Onboarding Training: Train new hires and existing employees on the importance of data in your organization's culture.
Example: Create a series of onboarding videos or workshops illustrating how data has historically impacted your company’s decisions. For senior leaders, initiate with WBRs, where new hires can see real-time data discussions, fostering immediate immersion. 
External Experts: Occasionally, bring in industry experts for specialized training sessions or talks.
Example: A renowned data scientist could conduct a session on the latest trends in data analytics or a leader from a successful data-driven company could be invited to share their experiences and best practices.
Skill Upgrade: Identify areas where your team's data skills can be enhanced. This could be a session on the latest trends in data visualization, data analytics, or even understanding certain concepts and tools better.
Example: Platforms like HowDo and YouTube offer a plethora of free courses tailored to specific data skill sets.
Empowering Employees
By leveraging data insights, you can refine internal processes, making everyday tasks more efficient and even enjoyable for your team. This internal empowerment can boost morale and productivity.
Example: By analyzing daily tasks, a software company identified repetitive tasks. They introduced automation tools, freeing employees to focus on creative problem-solving.
Consistency Over Flexibility
While flexibility is valuable, consistency is crucial when laying the groundwork for a data-driven culture. Adopting consistent data metrics and languages minimizes confusion and ensures that everyone is on the same page, streamlining collaborations and decision-making.
Example: A healthcare provider adopted a consistent format for patient data entry across all departments. This ensured seamless data flow when patients moved between departments.
Transparency in Decision-Making
Data-driven decisions are most effective when they're transparent. By promoting a culture where the rationale behind analytical choices is openly discussed, you foster a deeper understanding of these choices. This not only builds trust but also encourages a culture where data-driven decisions are the norm.
Example: A manufacturing company faced a decline in product quality. Management openly discussed how data analytics identified the issue and the steps taken to rectify it, fostering trust among employees.
—
The journey towards a data-driven culture is transformative, ensuring not just growth but a solid foundation for the future. With these principles and real-world examples in mind, you're well-equipped to infuse a data-led approach into your organization. After all, data isn't just numbers on a spreadsheet; it's the pulse of your business.

Transitioning to a data-driven culture is more than a strategic shift; it's a journey of empowerment, growth, and innovation. By following all seven steps, you're laying the groundwork for decisions that are not just informed but transformative. You're positioning your business to not only succeed in the present but to dominate in the future.
5. Building a Data-Driven Culture Through Accountability
For any business aiming to be data-driven, accountability stands as its backbone. A culture of accountability ensures that data doesn't just exist—it's actively used to inform decisions, drive innovation, and achieve business objectives.
Leadership's Role
Set the Tone: Leadership dictates the culture. Your commitment to a data-driven approach will inspire the entire organization.
Example: The CEO starts every quarterly review meeting with a segment on data insights and how they influenced the company's decisions during that period.
Lead by Example: Show that you value data in your decisions. This will set a precedent for your team.
Example: Before launching a new product, the VP of Product shares data-driven research on why this product meets market needs.
Reward Accountability: Recognize and reward those who make data-driven decisions and own their outcomes, whether successful or a learning opportunity.
Example: An employee who used data analytics to refine the company's marketing strategy is publicly acknowledged and given a bonus.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Provide clarity on what's important and show that decisions are anchored in measurable outcomes by regularly sharing and discussing KPIs with the team.
Example: The CMO sets quarterly KPIs for the marketing team, focusing on metrics that directly tie to the company's broader goals.
Clearly Define Roles and Responsibilities
Craft Detailed Job Descriptions: Ensure everyone knows their specific responsibilities and the expectations tied to them.
Example: The job description for a sales executive includes using Customer Relationship Management (CRM) data to identify sales trends and optimize strategies.
Set Specific Performance Objectives: By laying out clear goals, you give your team a roadmap to success.
Example: The customer support team is given a goal to reduce ticket resolution time by 15% based on data showing average resolution times.
Regular Check-ins: Regularly review individual performance to ensure alignment with company objectives and address any obstacles.
Example: Managers hold monthly one-on-ones with their direct reports to review data on their performance metrics.
WBRs (Weekly Business Reviews): Make WBRs a staple in your organization. These reviews offer a recurring checkpoint to ensure alignment with company objectives and provide an opportunity to adjust strategies based on recent data.
Example: The sales team holds WBRs to discuss the previous week's data, analyzing what worked, what didn't, and strategizing for the upcoming week.
Promote Ownership
Empower Decision-Making: Trust your team with data, equip them with the necessary resources, and give them the autonomy to execute tasks.
Example: A team lead is given access to customer feedback data and trusted to make adjustments to their team's strategy based on that feedback.
Provide Support: Ensure that team members have access to the training and resources they need to effectively utilize data.
Example: The company offers workshops on how to use the latest data analytics tools.
KPIs and WBRs: Combine the power of KPIs and WBRs. Set clear performance indicators and then utilize weekly reviews to monitor progress towards those KPIs. This continuous feedback loop ensures that teams remain agile, making data-informed adjustments in real-time.
Example: The operations team sets a KPI for reducing operational costs. In their WBRs, they assess their weekly progress, using data to pinpoint areas of improvement.
Consistent Feedback
Timely and Specific Feedback: Provide constructive feedback promptly after events (e.g.: product launches, major decisions, marketing campaign launches) to reinforce good behaviors and address areas of improvement.
Example: After a product launch, the product manager provides immediate feedback to the marketing team on how well the marketing campaign metrics matched up with sales data.
Celebrate Successes: Positive reinforcement can be as crucial as constructive feedback. Celebrate data-driven wins to encourage more of the same behavior.
Example: A shout-out in a company-wide email for a department that successfully used data to streamline operations and cut costs.
WBRs: Use WBRs as a platform to provide immediate feedback. Immediate insights after actions or decisions allow teams to understand the impact of their choices and learn in real-time.
Example: After a new product release, the team gathers in a WBR to discuss initial customer feedback and sales data, adjusting strategies as needed.
Setting Clear Expectations
Utilize SMART Goals: Goals should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.
Example: Instead of ""increase website traffic,"" a goal is set as ""increase website traffic by 10% over the next quarter using targeted content strategies.""
Communicate the ""Why"": Ensure your team understands the bigger picture—how their individual goals tie into the company's overarching objectives.
Example: When introducing a new company-wide data platform, leadership explains it's because data showed that the lack of accessible data was leading to inefficiencies.
KPIs: Utilize KPIs to provide clarity on expectations. Clear metrics offer a roadmap, showing teams what success looks like. 
Example: A customer service KPI is established to reduce complaint resolution times, providing the team with a clear performance target.
Incorporate Feedback Loops
Regular Assessments: Implement a consistent cycle of action, feedback, and strategy adjustment.
Example: After implementing a new data tool, the IT department holds quarterly reviews to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.
Open Communication Channels: Maintain avenues like one-on-one meetings or team debriefs to ensure feedback flows both ways.
Example: An online forum or chat channel is set up where employees can provide feedback on the new data analytics platform.
Feedback Collection Tools: Adopt tools that simplify feedback gathering, from both employees and customers.
Example: Tools like Microsoft Forms, Google Forms, Typeform or SurveyMonkey can be great for internal and external feedback.
KPIs and WBRs: Integrate feedback loops into your KPI and WBR processes. After setting performance indicators, use the weekly reviews to gather feedback on the team's progress towards these metrics. This iterative process ensures that goals remain relevant and teams stay aligned.
Example: The finance team sets a KPI for quarterly cost savings. In their WBRs, they review their progress, discussing challenges and strategies based on up-to-date data.

The journey to a data-driven culture takes continuous effort, commitment, and adjustment. Embracing a data-driven culture requires understanding the steps and then putting them in action. These examples provide a snapshot of how you can integrate data and accountability into the daily rhythm of your business, enhancing its growth and efficiency
With accountability as your guiding principle, you'll foster an environment where data is valued and integral to every decision made.
6. Harnessing Feedback: Your Roadmap to a Data-Empowered Team
In the age of data, your business's growth hinges on its ability to harness information and make informed decisions. Collecting data is just the first step. The real magic happens when feedback loops transform available data into actionable insights, driving a culture of accountability. Let's dive deep into how you can leverage feedback loops to sculpt a thriving data-driven culture in your organization.
6.1. Laying the Groundwork:
Objective: Start by defining what 'data-driven' means for your organization. For example, is it about improving product offerings, streamlining operations, or enhancing customer experiences?
Example: A SaaS company might use KPIs centered around user engagement metrics to continually refine its product features. 
Stakeholder Buy-In: Ensure key members of your organization are aligned with this data-driven vision. Their commitment will be instrumental in driving change.
Scenario: Conduct WBRs with department heads, discussing actionable insights and the week's data-driven achievements. 
Resource Allocation: Determine if you have the necessary tools and expertise to embark on this data journey. If not, consider investments in the right areas.
Pro Tip: Hiring an experienced, legitimate and credible data analyst (full- or part-time) and/or investing in robust analytics software can be game-changers.
6.2. Implementing Feedback Loops:
Clear Communication Channels: Foster a culture with open lines of communication where data can be discussed and validated.
Example: Set up WBRs where teams come together to share performance, weekly data trends and insights.
Act on Feedback: Ensure that the feedback provided is not just heard, but acted upon.
Example: After feedback shows that a certain data visualization tool is not user-friendly, the company decides to provide additional training sessions.
Iterative Approach: Understand feedback loops will evolve, therefore the first feedback loop might not be perfect. Continually improve the feedback loop by iterating and refining based on experiences and data.
Pro Tip: Start with a pilot feedback loop program in one department before a company-wide rollout.
6.3. Cultivating Accountability:
Role-specific Metrics: Define clear KPIs or metrics and assign them to specific roles in your organization. When everyone knows their metric, accountability becomes inherent.
Example: For a sales team, it could be the conversion rate; for the marketing team, it could be website traffic growth; and for product teams, it might be user engagement and retention metrics.
Public Dashboards: Display real-time KPIs publicly, driving motivation and accountability.
Example: Platforms like Tableau can visualize metrics, displayed in communal areas on monitors, TVs or projected for everyone to see.
6.4. Staying the Course:
Consistency: Regularly evaluate your feedback loops' efficiency and efficacy. Are they driving the desired change? If not, where's the gap?
Approach: Incorporate KPIs in your WBRs, ensuring each review benchmarks performance against set objectives. 
Refinement: Regularly evaluate your feedback mechanisms. When something isn't working, it's time for a change. Take for example, a data collection method that's falling short of providing actionable insights.
Example: Think about tweaking the process, adopting a new approach, or enhancing your methods to better capture and analyze the crucial facets of your business.
Culture Reinforcement: Celebrate the wins. Keep feedback loops open by regularly communicating the successes achieved through a data-driven approach. Celebrate even the small wins to reinforce the importance of a data culture.
Suggestions:
Use WBRs to share how KPI progress and open conversation around the tangible impacts of data-driven decisions.
Share monthly success stories where data played a pivotal role in making informed decisions.
By integrating data into your feedback loops, you're architecting a culture of continuous growth and accountability. As you embark on creating a data driven culture, each feedback cycle will make your business more agile, teams more data-driven, and decisions more strategic.",6359

1.1 What Is Your Hypothesis / What Are You Trying to Learn?
Understanding the ‘customer’ using the process of Entrepreneurial Innovation is a 3-step process:
Learning about the customer problem to come up with an idea; 
Speaking to additional customers to see if the idea solves the problem;
Engage in MVP testing to reiterate customer feedback. 
1.1.1 Learning about your customer problems to come up with an idea.
Most successful founders treat themselves as the first customer and solve their own problem. Take Airbnb: The year was 2007, and roommates Joe Gebbia and Brian Chesky couldn’t afford their San Francisco rent. The pair knew a big design conference was coming to San Francisco, and it was making hotels hard to come by. And so it all started with an email: Gebbia wrote Chesky with an idea: What if they turned their loft into a designer’s bed and breakfast, complete with a sleeping mat and breakfast? It was a way to “make a few bucks.” The duo, who had met at college at the Rhode Island School of Design, thought acting as tour guides to designers would be a fun way to make money. 12 years later, that idea is worth $31 billion.
1.1.2 Speaking to additional customers to see if your idea solves their problem.
Seeking customer feedback is an important process of being customer centric; the Uber case study is the perfect illustration of this. When Uber was first validating its idea (back when it was UberCab), Travis Kalanick, Uber’s Founder, was in charge of the Supply side. He cold-called 10 existing black-cab drivers and shared the concept of Uber. Three hung up, a few listened and three wanted to meet. The fact that 30% wanted to meet gave Travis the confidence that there was demand for his idea. The test is: Does the idea solve a problem the customer is  experiencing? 
1.1.3. Engage in MVP testing and reiterate on customer feedback.
MVP testing is an integral part of scaling a startup and the Slack case study is the perfect example of the importance of reiterating on customer feedback. When Slack first launched, they launched with around 10 companies and they begged and cajoled their friends at other companies to try it out and give them feedback. The Slack team was determined to seek answers and feedback from customers who already tried the product. 
All three examples demonstrate important customer discovery is to validate the venture fixes a customer problem. However, it is equally important to also understand what part of the customer discovery phase the venture is in.  
The best tactic to ensure you ask customers the right questions is by being clear on the hypothesis you are trying to prove/disprove. The following section demonstrates how important customer obsession is in the MVP discovery, design, development and testing process. You can also find more of this, in depth, in HowDo’s Product module. 
2. Why Customer Obsession Is Critical to Success
2.1 Why Spending Time Identifying Your Customer Helps You Build the Right Solution
Thought Exercise: Finding a customer for an idea
As an entrepreneur, understanding your customer is of the utmost importance. Take a moment now to visualize your idea and jot down who you think would be your customer. 
Now that you have identified a customer for your idea idea you have, stress-test your assumptions on who is your customer. This will help you gain a greater understanding of the customer as It is critical that you deeply understand their needs and pains. 
Case study: #2 Pencil
Now, a simple explanation of the importance of new ventures being customer centric is the #2 Pencil. In this case, we’ll look at a #2 pencil as a solution. Other possible examples might be Chromebook for education vs. Mac for professional/creative or Salesforce for enterprise vs. Hubspot for SMB.
Expand
A #2 pencil solves a perfect need for one customer: a high school teacher whose students are taking a multiple choice test. The pencil provides a solution that allows their students to mark multiple choice answers and erase them as needed. This solves the problem of excessive scribbles and illegible answers from students, which could be an issue if they chose to use ink pens. 
The #2 pencil is also a great solution for a range of other customers:
Accountants during tax time who write a lot and must easily erase mistakes; 
Writers who are constantly editing and revising their work;
Golfers who need to keep score on the course during a round;
Carpenters who need to draft markings on walls and other materials;
Artists who are crafting vibrant, colorful masterpieces.
Now, although the original yellow wood, medium darkness, medium softness #2 pencil is the perfect solution for the teacher/student scenario, it may not be for other user cases.
Expand
Golfers, for example, have no easy way to carry around a standard length 7.5” #2 pencil while on the golf course. Instead, golf courses provide a smaller solution, short pencils, that uniquely solves golfers’ problem of needing a portable writing utensil.
Expand
Similarly, carpenters also have unique needs because they are not just writing on paper. They might be writing on wood one day and stone the next. A larger size pencil with a higher grade of lead density helps carpenters ensure their markings are visible on any surface and are easy to trace.
Lastly, artists need color and require a variety of different stroke sizes and shades. For an artist, a #2 pencil alone might create one style of a masterpiece but it won’t meet all of their needs.
The point of the example is that a pencil (i.e. the solution) needs to transform into the right solution for the right customer (teachers, golfers, carpenters, etc.). This requires a deep understanding into the problem of the right customer and the primary use case. The fundamental truth is that an entrepreneur must first start their venture with a strong understanding of the customer and the customer’s problems, before prescribing a solution.
In summary, every type of customer has unique needs and you must solve for those.  If you only create one solution and try to sell it to everyone under the sun, you would not likely solve any one problem extremely well.
2.2 Examples of Customer Obsession
2.2.1 Amazon’s Customer Obsession
In 1997, Bezos penned a letter to shareholders stating Amazon would be customer driven rather than shareholder driven. This letter redefined how future startups would be formed, making it an essential read for any modern innovator and entrepreneur.
Ultimately, Bezos made it clear in the letter that meeting quarterly earnings calls and pleasing Wall Street analysts did not fit his idea of building value over the long term. He believed long-term value was about pleasing the customer and that ‘customer-centricity’ was key to long-term profits. 
The following are some snippets from the Shareholder Letter along with a loose interpretation of Bezos’ real meaning:
“We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand.” 
Interpreted:, “The customer, not you (shareholder), is what’s important.”
“We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term.” 
Interpreted: “We will not prioritize quarterly earnings or Wall Street’s reactions to them.”
“Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies.” 
Interpreted: “You (shareholder) may not like or understand what we decide to do, but we’re going to do it anyway.”
“We aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the ‘right’ investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we would be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.” 
Interpreted:, “You (shareholder) may not like or understand what we decide to do, and we will not be deterred.”
Amazon’s unparalleled growth has inspired other companies to adopt Bezos’ philosophy of customer obsession. The company’s success is rooted in always being one step ahead of knowing what the customer wants, before the customer even knows they want it, and then providing it. 
The term “customer obsession,” was coined by Bezos and has been the reason Amazon continually raises the bar on customer experience exceeding other retailers on price, selection, availability and delivery. Amazon successfully used their technical foundation to build services that now power a majority of Silicon Valley internet startups, and their fulfilment capability outperforms the largest incumbents, which include the United States Postal Service, FedEx, UPS and DHL. 
Amazon consistently expands its offerings to customers, while each new offering gives Amazon access to new customer data. Customer data provides Amazon with greater insights into their customers. As a result, Amazon is able to anticipate the needs of their customers and build even more products and services to meet customers’ needs. 
In a fascinating CNBC interview, with Bezos, from 1999, he discusses Amazon’s plans for scaling, which of course are based on servicing customers: 
Bezos: “I believe that if you can focus obsessively enough on customer experience, selection,  ease of use, low prices, more information to make purchase decisions… if you can give customers all that plus great customer service, and with our toys and electronics we have a 30-day return policy…then I think you have a good chance. And that’s what we’re trying to do.”
Bezos’ customer focus goes so far as to link the square footage of Amazon’s distribution space to the needs of the customer.
Bezos: “We have over 3,000 employees and over four million square feet of distribution center space. And those are things I’m very very proud of because with that distribution center space and half a dozen distribution centers around the country, it allows us to get products close to customers so that we can ship to customers in a very timely way, which improves customer service levels. That’s what we’re about. If there’s one thing Amazon.com is about is its obsessive attention to the customer experience, end to end.”
When the interviewer suggests that Amazon is a “pure Internet play” (a company only focused on a specific industry niche), Bezos clarifies that the statement is totally missing the point. 
Bezos: “It doesn’t matter to me whether we’re a pure Internet play… we provide the best customer service…They [our investors] should be investing in a company that obsesses over customer experience in the long term. There is never any misalignment between customer interests and shareholder interests.”
At one point, the interviewer compares Amazon, an e-commerce retailer with distribution centers, to Walmart, which has physical retail stores, and suggests that Amazon’s model is cost heavy. Bezos explains that, on the contrary, distribution centers cost less than retail space. However, the interviewer doubles down on his suggestion that Amazon’s model is too bold. The conversation follows…
Interviewer: “OK. So, you’ll open as many square feet of physical space as you have to hire as many employees, as you have…”
Bezos: “to service customers. Absolutely. And we’ll do it as rapidly as we can.”
Interviewer: “That’s a very cost-intense proposition.”
Bezos, patiently, explains the logic and the math.
Bezos: “Not compared to opening an equivalent network of retail stores. Look, when we open a distribution center, we’re opening places where we may pay 30 cents a square foot for a lease instead of paying $7 a square foot for retail space, which you might pay in a high traffic retail area. So when you compare those things, they’re not the same. You can’t compare a big chain of retail stores to half a dozen distribution centers. It’s just not, you know, it’s bad math.”
The interviewer remains dubious. 
Interviewer: “Either way, whichever side of the argument, you believe you’re making, it seems to me…”
Bezos: “There’s only one side, which is to obsess over customers.”
The interview continues with the interviewer questioning the razor thin profit margins he suggests Amazon must work with; Bezos explains the rationale behind the company’s scaling.
Bezos: “We’re opening new product categories, and we’re expanding in new geographies. We have whole new business models with things like auctions. Now, we think this is the less risky of the two approaches because scale is important in this business. And you need scale also to offer the lowest prices and the best customer service to people. So scale is important to us, and we’re going to go after that kind of scale.”
The interviewer continues with his argument and accuses Bezos of being arrogant which ultimately shows the interviewer’s short-sightedness.
Interviewer: “Isn’t it to some extent a certain amount of, with all do respect, corporate arrogance, to assume that you can come into these businesses, which you have no experience in, and virtually overnight become the best in those businesses and the market leader in those businesses?”
Bezos: “I don’t think so. So, you know, when we first started selling books four years ago, everybody said, look you’re just computer guys you don’t know anything about selling books. And that was true. But what we really cared about was customers, and now we know a lot about books. When we first started selling music, people said the same thing, but we hired the right people… so, you know, we take the commitment to the customer very seriously, and we’re not about to release something or announce something before it’s ready.”
Overall, the interview underscores Amazon’s complete dedication to the customer, which is common sense to Bezos yet so often overlooked by other companies. Bezos expresses amazement that no one has caught up with their customer approach and states, “we faced no like-minded competition for seven years.”
2.2.2 Startup Examples of Customer Obsession
Fast forward to today and the current e-commerce landscape has changed. There are now millions of other independent, direct to consumer (D2C) brands which are dedicated to the customer and have found a unique voice online, outside of the traditional retail model. Three examples, discussed in further details below,  of such brands are Bonobos, the trendy men’s clothing manufacturer; Warby Parker, the online prescription eyewear manufacturer; and Casper, a company that has disrupted the mattress industry.
2.2.2.1 Bonobos 
Bonobos was founded by Andy Dunn and Brian Spaly when they noticed how hard it was for men to find a pair of pants that fit. The brand began as an online retailer andwas later bought by Walmart, in 2017, for $310 million. 
According to Casey Drake, writer for Endear:
“From day 1, Bonobos vowed to take a different approach to their business model. Instead of investing money in traditional marketing methods, they instead invested in their customer experience and success teams. What resulted was a cult following willing to buy in to whatever new interesting concepts the brand would try.” 
Dunn described their approach as “maniacally focused on the customer experience and interacting, transacting and storytelling to consumers.” The company’s popularity grew through word of mouth driven by brand loyalists. 
2.2.2.2 Warby Parker
Another brand that focused on customer centricity is Warby Parker, the online retailer of prescription glasses and sunglasses. Warby Parker was founded in 2010 by Neil Blumenthal, Andrew Hunt, David Gilboa and Jeffrey Raider, four students from Wharton. Described as “the most innovative startup of America” by Yashica Vashishtha, writer for YourTechStory, the four entrepreneurs introduced stylish customized eyewear to the online consumer. 
Warby Parker’s competitors were Luxottica and LensCrafters. Luxottica sold stylish eyewear, but the prices were high end, and Lenscrafters lacked any sense of style in its branding. Warby Parker’s eyewear options were both appealing and affordable and allowed customers the convenience of trying on up to five pairs in the comfort of their own homes. According to Gilboa, one of the cofounders, “The idea was really based on two simple premises. One is that a pair of glasses should not cost more than an iPhone, and two, that eyeglasses could effectively be sold online.”
The niche product gained immediate traction and further gained popularity after Vogue covered the Warby Parker’s story within the first year of its launch. The brand exuded trendiness, style and a dash of exclusivity, while also being universal. Warby Parker’s branding and customer-focus built a defensive wall that protected them from competitors and other eyeglass manufacturers.
Warby Parker has now gone on to launch physical stores and built its own manufacturing capabilities in an optical lab in Rockland County, New York. In 2018, the company was valued at around $1.75 billion, making it one of the most successful D2C brands in the world. 
2.2.2.3 Casper
Casper, an online retailer of mattresses and sleep products, is another brand which used customer experience to disrupt a traditional retail industry. Casper achieved the extraordinary feat of persuading customers to buy a mattress online without first touching/feeling the product. It seems rather counterintuitive that buying a mattress without first trying it would be in the customer’s interests – afterall, who wants a mattress that is too hard, too soft and not just right? 
So Casper, through smart marketing, gained the trust of the customer to such an extent that they were willing to entrust Casper with the responsibility of choosing the right mattress for their needs, saving them a whole lot of time and trouble. Using data on actual experiences and customer reviews, $75 gift-card referrals, plus a 100-day guarantee, Casper found the customer’s pain point and fixed it. 
Ultimately, Casper built a relationship with the customer and made sure they were educated on their potential purchases, giving them peace of mind—a huge factor for big-ticket items. In January 2020, Casper filed for an IPO (initial public offering) with an initial valuation of $1.1 billion, after its private funding round in March 2019.
2.2.3 Google Cloud: A Failure To Obsess Over the Customer
Amazon’s narrative was originally denounced and met by countless skeptics. Consider the interview with Jeff Bezos at the beginning of this article where the interviewer accused Bezos of exhibiting “corporate arrogance.”
Through its customer mindset, Amazon has obtained long-term permission from the customer and now has long-term permission from Wall Street. Wall Street is no dummy. It looks right to the customer to figure out whether a company is relevant and what it’s future might be. Overall, Wall Street looks at the value chain, and Amazon looks at the customer value chain.
Most entrepreneurs are familiar with the value chain. It is described by Google as “the process or activities by which a company adds value to an article [product], including production, marketing and the provision of after-sales service.”  
Fast-forward a few years, and companies like Amazon are now looking at the value chain from the customer perspective. The ‘customer value chain’ is now all of the steps that a customer must take in order to acquire products and services. Therefore, the chain also includes online searching by the customer to learn about a product, product selection, finding a website to buy the product from, clicking, choosing delivery options and so on. For an online retailer, the customer value chain has many more elements to fulfill; therefore, what adds value for the customer, is fewer steps in the acquisition process—enter Amazon’s 1-click ordering.
Google Cloud, on the other hand, is an example of how the customer value chain has not gone quite so well, as Ben Thompson of Strategery explains in an in-depth article.
Selling cloud infrastructure does not seem like much of a stretch for Google considering the vast cloud infrastructure Google uses to power its search engine. The problem, though, is that Google’s value chain is just that, a value chain, not a customer value chain. According to Thompson, “The world of enterprise software is not a self-serve world for the customer (and to the extent it is, Amazon Web Services (AWS) dominates the space). Google, to sell its cloud infrastructure, needs an intermediary layer to interact with relatively centralized buyers with completely different expectations from consumers when it comes to product roadmap visibility, customer support, and pricing.”
Google Cloud remains a distant third to AWS and Microsoft when it comes to cloud technology because Google lacks capabilities in customization, support, and the ability to sell. 
Google’s culture has been, according to Thompson, “about making the best product technologically and waiting for customers to line-up. That may have worked for Search and for VMWare, but it’s not going to work for Google Cloud. Instead, the company needs to actually get out there and actually sell, develop the capability and willingness to tailor their offering to customers’ needs, be willing to build features simply because they move the needle with CIOs, and actually offer real support.” 
The takeaway here is that for Google Cloud to work, Google should focus not on technology innovation, but rather on its customer.

No efficient customer acquisition pipeline, digital experience or sales funnel is sufficiently broad and effective to allow for a diversity of customers in the very early stages of a new venture. As an entrepreneur, you must put “all your eggs in one basket” to maximize the impact of your limited resource. That’s why it’s really important to constantly assess your understanding of the customer and adapt your approach to their problem accordingly. 
Who is the startup’s target customer?
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________
Teacher note: The answer is that they don’t know who their customer is but they think they could have one of four possible customer segments.
If you were the founder of the startup what might you do to improve your understanding of your customer?
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________
Teacher note: The answer we’re looking for stems from part two of the session and is that they should conduct more research into the possible customer segments to understand who they are best able to solve a concrete problem for.
Which of the four target customer segments outlined do you think is the best?
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________
Teacher note: While students should be able to present a personal opinion here the answer we’re looking for is that it’s hard to say without conducting additional research.
The key takeaway is that if the startup can focus on one of their four customer segments, they can design the perfect solution for that customer. However, designing a solution to serve all four customer segments will leave none of the four customer segments satisfied because the startup’s attention is spread too thin across multiple, unique needs.
Additional Discussion Questions
As a new company should you have 1 target customer segment, 3 target customer segments, or 5 target customer segments? Why?
If you are aware of10 potential customers, in one customer segment, yet have identified your one target customer segment is different, should you proceed to sell to those 10 potential customers anyway?
If a big company, i.e. a potential customer, that is outside of your one, single target customer segment sees another use for your product or technology, should you entertain it? 
Note: Most of the time, big companies drain resources. The contracting, legal and compliance processes associated with big companies are often more than a few month’s funding for early stage ventures. 
Here are some possible points of view that may emerge in answers to the assignment:
Kiwibot’s technology serves so many people’s needs! They’re going to be a huge company!
The problem here is that each of the four customers outlined (restaurant, government, delivery apps, and developers) have unique problems that require unique value propositions.
Additionally, they’re spread thin when trying to build 4 different solutions at once.
Each of the four customer types they serve has a different problem.
Yes, they’ve outlined different problems for each.
Can their one solution solve for each of these four problems?
I don’t understand who their customer is…
Exactly, and it appears that they don’t either which indicates that they could be confused or lacking focus.
3. Preparing to Learn About Your Customer and Company
3.1 Types of Knowledge
In Entrepreneurial Innovation your level of risk is determined by your knowledge. The more you know, the less risk you face. The less you know, the more risks you face. Therefore, it is important to understand both what you do and do not know. 
Expand
To expand upon this matrix, 
Expand
The first thing that must be immediately obvious is that knowledge is relative, unto itself and between people. Therefore, the “we” in this matrix is interchangeable with “I”, “You”, “They”, etc… 
3.1.1 the Interplay of Knowledge and Risk
To be effective in this transition, we must first confront the reality of how we perceive risk. 
Opinions are not knowledge. Facts and data that result from quantitative measurement are knowledge. Qualitative insights and executive perspectives are either Known Unknowns or Unknown Knowns but they are never Known Knowns. 
Which in turn translates into different levels of perceived and actual risk:
Expand
It’s important to contextualize that knowledge is entirely relative. Whereas one demographic “knows” something, another demographic may not yet be aware of the knowledge or may not have accepted the knowledge. This relative distribution of knowledge is particularly important in the context of business as the intent of any good organization is to direct its resources. 
On any given team there could be a variety of knowns. To this end, one of the primary purposes of a team should be to optimize the distribution of known knowns by compositing a team who has the requisite knowledge to achieve the goals of a particular task. 
To truly know the customer, you must first get into the mindset to learn.  
3.2 Customer Mindset
When learning about your customer, leave your biases at the door. 
“Real self-confidence is not reflected in a title, an expensive suit, a fancy car or a series of acquisitions. It is reflected in your mindset: your readiness to grow.”
– Carol Dweck, a pioneering researcher at Stanford who specializes in the field of motivation, why people succeed (or don’t) and how to foster success.
You must be willing to look at old problems with a new perspective and understand them anew. You cannot start with preconceptions of what the data will tell you. This is also known as having “beginner’s mind”:
“In the Beginner’s Mind there are many possibilities. In the expert’s mind there are few.” 
– Zen Master Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind. 
You must have the strength to let your ideas go and the openness to learn:
“The true test of self-confidence is the courage to be open—to welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source.”
– Jack Welch
As you learn about your customer, you must allow the shape of your idea to change shape inline with the customer.
“You must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can drip and it can crash. Become like water my friend.” 
– Bruce Lee
To achieve this, you must be able to understand and sympathize (ideally: empathize) with the customer:
“there is no way for our innovation to meet unmet unarticulated needs (…) if we don’t listen not just listen to the words but go and go deep to understand what the needs are behind it core innovation” 
– Satya Nadela (CEO, Microsoft) speaking with David Rubenstein (co-founder and co-executive chairman of The Carlyle Group)
You must be open to having your initial idea be incorrect. It is much more effective, and will serve you better long-term to invalidate ideas rather than just validate ideas. 
“(T)hose who change their minds are the biggest winners because they learned something, whereas those who stubbornly refuse to see the truth are losers.”
– Ray Dalio, American billionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist and founder of the world’s largest hedge fund
3.3 “brave Space” / Invalidate, Don’t Validate
We must start the learning journey with the open mindset that is needed to conduct customer discovery. It is important that every innovator recognizes that the search for knowledge is the highest priority, even if it makes some people uncomfortable. Participants must be allowed to openly and honestly explore and learn about what is measurably occurring.
What makes innovators great is that they are passionate about an idea and committed. So openness and being incorrect may not be the most natural for innovators, founders, entrepreneurs, managers or anyone. It is important to leave your biases at the door and as you acquire knowledge, be ready to invalidate ideas, rather than to validate every idea. This will help in the long-term and save time, money, emotional anguish and credibility!
There are a range of biases that you should explore in yourself before pursuing a venture:
confirmation biases;
self-serving biases;
optimism/pessimism biases;
sunk cost bias.
Taking a few practical commitments BEFORE talking to customers can help you “get into the mindset”:
Commit to the notion that “words are your data”. Record, record, record. That way you can listen again after.
Make a commitment to solve disagreements based on what customers say. Are you and your co-founders or coworkers arguing about something that can be answered with a customer point of view? For example, your customer thinks feature A should be next, you think feature B. Solving disagreements based on customers input can take some emotion and bias out of the decisions.
Remember – by focusing on the customer’s problem and not your idea, you will be better off in the long term. You will waste less time and money. This only serves as a help to you.
3.4 Act Like a Journalist
As an innovator, try to embody the characteristics of a journalist, such as:
They want to learn
They ask open-ended questions
They prepare, they come with questions (example questions are further down in this article)
They re-ask (sometimes in different ways) if questions are not answered or avoided
They record and take notes.
Similar to the “brave space”, do not try to get the customer to validate your hypothesis. If you go in with the “brave space” mindset, and ask open ended questions, you will be surprised by things your customer says. That is what you want!
In the very early stages of learning about the customer, it is imperative that you personally are gathering customer data. Acquiring customer knowledge should not be outsourced as knowing your customer intimately can be one of your greatest assets. Personally working with customers will allow you to ask questions and clarify feedback, to create intimate customer knowledge,a priority of a great entrepreneur!
3.5 Keep a Customer Mindset
The foundational difference between companies that have a short-term focus and those that have a long-term focus is the company’s mindset. Short-term, investor focused companies have “Business Mindset”. Long-term, customer-focused companies have a “Customer Mindset”. It is this simple, yet foundational difference in mindset, which separates companies that successfully innovate and grow against companies that struggle to remain competitive.
These differences play out across the business: 
CUSTOMER: The business mindset’s customer is the investor, while the customer-mindset’s customer is the end user. 
FOCUS: A business mindset focuses on the P&L, while a customer mindset focuses on the customer.
GOALS and INCENTIVES: The business mindset strives to hit quarterly numbers and annual commitments. Meanwhile, the customer mindset strives to solve customer problems.
PLANNING: The business mindset plans in quarterly increments towards annual plans, measured in dollars. Conversely, the customer mindset plans towards near-term customer acquisition, measured in long-term customer satisfaction.
REPLANNING: Great business plans are reliably drafted no more than a year in advance and include incredible precision. Great customer roadmaps are multi-year and include tremendous uncertainty.
FLEXIBILITY: The best business plans afford little deviation from the plan. Meanwhile, the best customer plans secure permission to consistently optimize the trajectory of the company and its offerings, as new information is made available.
Table 1 breaks out the differences for easier comparison: 
Business Dimension Business Mindset Customer Mindset
Customer Investor End-User
Focus P&L Customer
Goals and Incentives Quarterly Numbers and Annual Commitments Customer Problems
Planning Plans in quarterly increments towards annual plans that are designed to create shareholder value Plans towards near-term customer acquisition measured in long-term customer satisfaction
Replanning Great business plans are reliably drafted no more than a year in advance and include incredible precision. Great product roadmaps are multi-year and include tremendous uncertainty.
Flexibility The best business plans afford little deviation from the plan. The best product plans secure permission to consistently optimize the trajectory of the product as new information is made available.
Table 1. Differences between short-term, investor focused companies (those with“Business Mindset”) and long-term, customer-focused companies (those with a “Customer Mindset”).
Most people are more widely familiar with the Business Mindset. It is taught in schools and, if you work in a traditional company, reinforced by the incentives you are given at work. 
Innovation in business mindset companies consists of creating short-term gains to appease shareholders, often at the expense of the customer experience and the long-term relevance and viability of the company. This often futile approach is known as “innovation theater”, where a company does things to appease shareholders and not customers. 
3.6 Data Saturation
When an entrepreneur begins their primary market research, a critical question is ‘to how many customers should I speak in the first place’? Is it 5 or 50 or 100? What is that magic number? In reality, there is no magic number – however, a great way to gauge the stopping point is when you reach ‘data saturation’.
Data saturation refers to the point in the research process when no new information is discovered in data analysis, and this redundancy signals to researchers that data collection may cease. Saturation means that a researcher can be reasonably assured that further data collection would yield similar results and serve to confirm emerging themes and conclusions. When researchers can claim that they have collected enough data to achieve their research purpose, they should report how, when and to what degree they achieved data saturation.
One thing to iterate is that once an entrepreneur reaches data saturation → Stop! Customer discovery is an ongoing process which you must commit to throughout your venture life. However, once you hit data saturation, move towards sharing what you learned and executing the ideas. 
While there is no “magic number” on when you or a team will reach data saturation, it can be after 6 or 20 interviews, Google “demonstrates that asking five customers will uncover 85% of the problems.” That said, you ultimately have to choose whether you know enough to stop or keep going.
Many entrepreneurs struggle to talk to their customers, especially in their early days. It may take you time to get comfortable having honest conversations with customers and potential customers. However, these conversations are incredibly important because they are the foundation for any business. As referenced in the Research section of this article; a key book recommendation for any entrepreneur is ‘Talking to Humans’, by Giff Constable. It is available as an online PDF here: https://www.talkingtohumans.com/
3.7. Warmup: Review of Existing Literature
To help you find out more about your customer, how to segment them, and how to find out the problem that you can solve, the following section summarizes three important bodies of research: ‘Talking to Humans’, ‘Disciplined Entrepreneurship’ introduces the Beachhead Customer and ‘‘Competing against Luck’ introduces “Jobs to be Done”.
3.7.1 Primary Market Research / ‘Talking to Humans’
In his book, “Talking to Humans”, Giff Constable stresses that there is no replacement for talking to your customers in person. He highlights a typical entrepreneur, who is obsessed about the product and often has many hypotheses – some of which may be right, but others won’t be. He then challenges entrepreneurs to “get ahead of the risk hypothesis that may cause failure” by first laying out the riskiest hypothesis of the business. For those risks having to do with customer, he suggests a three-pronged approach:
Walk in the customer shoes and buy the product they would buy (ie., your competitor, the replacement, etc);
Observe customers that are in the process of buying what you are selling;
Talk directly to the people you want to be your customers. 
Prior to conducting primary market research, Constable recommends answering the following questions:
What do you want to learn?
From who do you want to learn?
How will you get to them?
How can you ensure an effective session?
How do you make sense of what you learn?
By answering these questions, it ensures your primary market research is much more effective than if you go and ask random people questions. One challenge is determining your “beachhead customer” (further defined in the next session) and finding ways to reach them. However, by being targeted and focused, you ensure finding that persona who is passionate about your idea and has a burning problem to be solved.
Many technology-first innovators tend to prefer to stay in the lab or behind the computer and not talk to customers. Business Innovators generally are happy to talk to customers. However, most approach primary market research as a way to validate their ideas. As an innovator, it is important to get out of the lab (or Powerpoint) and talk to your customers, but it is equally important to not only aim to validate your idea. You want the truth, as that will serve you best in the long term.
To dive deeper into Constable’s theory, view the  PDF online here: https://www.talkingtohumans.com/ or book on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Talking-Humans-Success-understanding-customers-ebook/dp/B00NSUEUL4 
3.7.2 Beachhead Customer / ‘Disciplined Entrepreneurship’
In Disciplined Entrepreneurship, Bill Aulet focuses on the need of selecting a beachhead customer, and defines the beachhead market as:
The customers within the market all buy similar products;
The customers within the market have a similar sales cycle and expect products to provide value in similar ways;
There is “word of mouth” between customers in the market, meaning they can serve as compelling and high-value references for each other in making purchases. 
Identifying a beachhead customer enables the entrepreneur to build a product/service for a segment of customers that have a burning problem.  Further, the venture will attract efficiencies of scale in the market, both through more scalable product development and marketing.
For example, when you think of Amazon, you may think of electronics, clothing or even groceries, but remember that they were laser focused on physical books in the early stages. Once the company dominated that category for their beachhead customer, they were able to expand outward and offer additional products to more customers.
To learn more about Bill Aulet’s theory of the beachhead customer, buy the book: https://www.amazon.com/Disciplined-Entrepreneurship-Steps-Successful-Startup/dp/1118692284/ 
3.7.3 Customer Insight – ‘Jobs to Be Done’
In his work on customer insights, Clay Christensen found that innovation is a top priority and simultaneously a key frustration point for global leaders. This is unusual as businesses today know more about their customers than ever before! Christensen, et al. determined that it is not about the quantity of knowledge about your customers but rather, focusing on what the customer hopes to accomplish. He calls this the “job to be done”, a job which you can solve.
One example that Christensen gives is an example of a company constructing high-end condos for people looking to downsize. All of their primary market research asked about features; for example, nicer windows. However, this didn’t budget sales. After zooming out in their discussions with potential customers, the company realized that it was not a feature of the condo that needed to be better but that potential customers had anxiety about moving their lives away from a home they had lived in for decades. This profound understanding enabled the company to adjust their messaging and gain more success. By acquiring customer insight, the company switched their mindset from being a new home construction company to a company in the business of moving lives. 
Similarly to the above example, many entrepreneurs may focus too much on a specific product or feature when conducting their primary market research. “Jobs to be done” is a great framework to remind entrepreneurs to zoom out and focus on that problem in people’s lives. Customers will buy products and services to solve a problem; yet successful entrepreneurs must first figure out the problem to subsequently figure out the “job” of your product or service.
To learn more about Clay Christensen’s theory on jobs to be done, buy the book ‘Competing against Luck’: https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612/ 
Activity 2: Evaluate Your Customer and Business
Activity 2.1: if You Have Existing Customers, Baseline Existing Knowledge.
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)
Benefits: If your company collects CSAT data then you have a readily available and relatively free source of data.
Drawbacks: CSAT data will be biased to just those customers who made contact with the CSAT team. You will want a broader cohort to ensure you have a full picture of your customers.
Exit surveys
Benefits: Exit surveys can be a rich source of data. What better way to determine what your customers want than by asking what was wrong when a customer stopped using your product?
Drawbacks: Exit surveys will contain information from passionate users. Some of the perspectives may be overblown, but they should never be dismissed. Try to pinpoint the core reason that the user is leaving.
Existing customer surveys
Benefits: If positioned correctly, a survey of existing customers can be an excellent way to discover pain points. Survey responses can be acquired fairly cheaply, often through the draw of free services or a gift card.
Drawbacks: These are your existing customers—they already relate to your product. Responses may cement choices that are catering to customers in a diminishing segment.
Focus groups
Benefits: Focus groups expose and explore general customer pain points.
Drawbacks: Data from this tool can be too general.
Market surveys
Benefits: Market surveys provide control over the data gathered.
Drawbacks: With that control comes limited overall knowledge.
Net Promoter Score (NPS)
Benefits: Industry standard simple question can illuminate areas of strength and weakness in your brand, product or service. Also, NPS is very quick and easy for the customer.
Drawbacks: More research will be required for deeper insights.
There are a few ways to collect this data, from low-cost do-it-yourself to expensive managed services.
Low-Cost, Do-It-Yourself
Google Forms
Qualtrics
Survey Monkey
Expensive Managed Services
Market Research Firms
dunnhumby
Ipsos
IRI
Kantar
Nielsen
Westat
Wood MacKenzie
Expert Networks
AlphaSights
Coleman Research
GLG
The data you collect from this process is the foundation for everything that you will do next. To ensure you get the right data, explore as many options as you can. Ideally you will find a tool or firm that has prior experience researching and analyzing your intended customers.
Activity 2.2: Baseline Your Knowledge of the Customer (Knowledge Matrix)
List the riskiest assumptions for your idea or business: –
–
–
What (open ended) questions can you ask customers to learn more about one of your risky assumptions? –
–
–
What assumptions do you have about your customer? 
Note: Acquired knowledge will come via the next activities [Picture of customer]
What do they need?
By when do they need it?
Demographic Information
Psychographic Information
What keeps them up at night?
What is the favorite thing they own?
Activity 2.3: Research Tracker
In order to get a real understanding of your customer you must actually talk to them! To get started, you should first identify where you can find your potential customers. Once they are identified, you should approach the individuals and record their names. 
Step 1:Finding People to Talk To
Start by making a list of 5 places where potential customers generally gather. Places include a specific aisle of the supermarket, stores they frequent, or Facebook groups in which they congregate.
Where potential customers gather:
__________________________________
__________________________________
__________________________________
__________________________________
__________________________________
Step 2: Record names and details
Now that you have identified the places your potential customers gather, visit these places and get permission to quiz customers inside. With permission, approach customers by letting them know the study you are conducting and the goal of your conversation. Once they agree to be surveyed, ensure you write down their name and the notes you gather. Encourage them to document their top objectives for the call. Ask open ended questions.

Activity 2.4: Pattern Tracker
Now that you have identified your customer and are recording your conversation, it’s important take note of certain patterns in their feedback. The attached worksheet can be used to track patterns and themes that emerge from the conversations with potential customers. In the first column, you can list the potential customers, themes and patterns should be written in the first row and in the end, tally up all of the occurrences for each pattern to identify those that are most prevalent. 
Patterns to look out for include attitudes they may have, problems they face or other considerations. Patterns will vary so the most important consideration is to track whichever patterns you see and set them aside for discussion with your team. 
Note:it is important to not be deceived by patterns at the qualitative level of research. These patterns should only form the basis of your quantitative research. To truly enhance your pattern recognition, you must also track demographics and psychographics to identify whether patterns or themes are related to those characteristics.

These can be identified as patterns that emerge from potential customers and deserve focus.
4. Identifying Your Customer
Now that you know that it is important to focus on one customer segment, you must determine what that customer segment is and who is a part of it. How do you do that? 
Talking to (potential) customers, start with a little bit of secondary market research:
How large is the overall market you’re targeting?
Who are the primary purchasers in the market you’re targeting?
What other companies are operating in this market? Who are the biggest players? 
Is every competing company doing the same thing or variations of your plan?
How much purchasing power is in the market?
Seeking answers to these questions will give you a little bit of background on the market you are entering and will provide you with some knowledge before engaging in a conversation with a potential customer.
Once you have some background information, focus on talking to customers rather than relying on generic online data. Once the conversation starts, explore their interests and thoughts rather than selling them your vision or ideas. At this point, they are not purely customers, rather, they are your guiding posts to your end product.
Many entrepreneurs will think of this as an excellent opportunity to send out a survey, but surveys are quantitative therefore you will only produce measurable results. Instead, you must start with qualitative research to build a foundational set of assumptions that you can test with your quantitative research.
Qualitative Research
Start with qualitative research where you:
Interview people in a conversation;
Observe people as they complete tasks;
Immerse yourself in the life of a potential customer by doing what they do;
Conduct user tests to watch them use a product.
In qualitative research:
You can learn a lot about things you didn’t know, even though it is time consuming;
Open ended questions and answers allow you to effectively learn more about your customer in their own words;
Customers may ask or answer questions you have not yet thought of;
You can learn what you would then want to explore or validate in quantitative research.
Through these research tactics you should be looking to uncover answers to questions like:
What is their daily life like?
How many children do they have?
What is their career and why are they on that path?
What are their day-to-day priorities?
What problems do those you are interviewing face?
Which problems are the highest priority for them?
How do they solve these problems today?
What is the value of a solution to the problem for them personally?
Who do they make purchasing decisions with?
This is just a simple selection and you may need to find other answers to truly get to know the customer. There may be additional questions or modifications of the questions above depending on the industry you are working within and who you have interviewed.
Remember: when talking to customers, you cannot make major assessments about a group of customers based on what one person says. Instead you must identify the patterns and themes that emerge from research across subjects. To validate what you have learned in qualitative research, move on to quantitative research. 
Quantitative Research
Quantitative research methods, such like surveys, allow you to collect data on a statistically significant number of customers:
You can get the most possible data with less time investment;
It’s far easier and requires less logistics/scheduling;
You don’t have to actually talk to customers
^^^ ALSO, common pitfall, which is why you should start by talking to customers.
A deeper understanding of your customer and the problems they face is critical in helping you craft a value proposition for the solution you are presenting. When thinking about your customer segment, you should be looking at an in-depth understanding of the following characteristics about your ideal customer:
Demographics
Age
Gender
Marital Status
Income
Education
Employment
Psychographics
Ideals
Personality
Interests
Opinions
Values
4.1 Psychographic
To introduce Psychographic – which captures human traits based on psychological attributes, start with this mental exercise:
Think about your favorite brand.
Now, list down everything about yourself* which would explain why you are so drawn to that particular brand.
______________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________
*List down things about yourself: Example, perhaps your attraction to Nike is due to your desire to run a marathon someday. Or perhaps you are an early adapter so you love Apple products.
You likely did not just list down demographic information about yourself. While demographic information may play a role in why you are drawn to a brand, it is likely that the psychographic information about yourself is the bigger driver in why a brand speaks to you.
In short, some entrepreneurs may tick the box by doing demographic surveys, but nothing replaces in-person conversations with customers, where you can best uncover motivations, attitude, aspirations and other psychological information. With this information, you will be able to build the best products and the best messaging for that customer.
One example that shows the importance of both demographic and psychographic information is through the customer persona that Lululemon came up with in their early days:
Ocean
32 year old professional woman
Makes $100K a year
Engaged
Owns her own condo
Loves to travel
Loves clothing and is very fashionable
Never misses a workout; dedicates1.5 hours each day to work out
By understanding your customers motivations and priorities, it allows you to better speak to them and reach them, which is essential for all entrepreneurs. Ultimately, you will have enough data to formulate customer profiles called “personas”. A persona is one ideal target customer that represents a series of other customers with the same or similar characteristics as them.
4.2 Aligning Around the Persona
Once you have  narrowed in on a group of like-minded target customers, you must figure out how to represent them accurately. The simplest way is to choose the real target customer who most embodies the characteristics of the group of customers you’re seeking to serve. Once the accurate persona is chosen, you should create a customer profile that lists their name, a headshot, and all additional details about them that are common amongst their target customer group. This information is called a persona.
A persona provides a deep understanding of your customer which significantly derisks innovation investments;
Empower yourself to understand and consequently empathize with customer;
Align your team with the customer;
Provides a customer for you to refer back to when trying to make decisions;
Allows you and your team to synthesize (and not forget!) all your findings.
Expand
Why is it important to write all of this information about the target customer out? 
Some may argue that it’s busy work, saying
It’s more beneficial to simply go spend time talking to or selling to more customers.
This is incorrect because it doesn’t align the team around one persona.
Some may believe that this helps ensure you have your bases covered.
This is true, but it’s not the coreanswer. We don’t need to check boxes here – we need to ensure that we truly know who our customer is.
Others may propose that it’s beneficial to get everyone on the same page.
This is correct. The entire team should be getting to know the customer. alignment is ultimately what ensures that everyone’s further actions support the customer.
Activity 3: Defining Your Customer
Activity 3.1 Building Customer Personas
Build personas for 3 types of customers:
Existing: your current customers 
Existing but do not use your solution: your competitor’s customers 
Not existing – outside our beachhead 
No Skipping – The reason the step must be done:
A deep understanding of your customer significantly derisks innovation investments by empowering team members to ideally: empathize with customers. 
Who is involved in the step?
If you’re a solo entrepreneur – just you
If you’re working with a team, representatives from every department that interfaces with the customer should participate
What will you need? 
Qualitative interview responses from at least 5 customers from each group.
Recall: Google “demonstrates that asking five customers will uncover 85% of the problems.” 
Quantitative data from the customers on which you choose to focus.
Statistically significant deep dives into the customer 
Where do you do the step?
In a “brave space” (https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/safe-spaces-brave-spaces) where the search for knowledge is the highest priority, even if it makes some people uncomfortable. Participants must be allowed to openly and honestly explore and learn about what is measurably occurring.
When do you know if you’re done? 
When you have achieved data saturation.
Step Instructions:
1) Qualitative Data

Activity 3.2 Determining Your Beachhead Customer
Once you’ve determined your personas, you must now choose which one will be your beachhead customer. As previously mentioned, Bill Aulet mentions the need for selecting a beachhead customer in his book, ‘Disciplined Entrepreneurship’. He defines the beachhead market as:
Customers within the market who all buy similar products;
Customers within the market have a similar sales cycle and expect products to provide value in similar ways;
There is “word of mouth” between customers in the market, meaning they can serve as compelling and high-value references for each other in making purchases. 
Some important nuances to discuss when determining your beachhead customer:
Does your customer have a different economic buyer than the end user? For instance, an educational startup will have an end user (the child) and an economic buyer (the parent);
When selling B2B it is important to know what type of company you are targeting and the people to whom you will be selling. While your end user may be in marketing, you may have to sell through finance, technology, operations and many of the management and executive layers. Therefore, these will be part of your beachhead. 
Activity 3.3 Integrating Customer
This is a crucial step that is often forgotten! You have done all this hard work talking to your customers and understanding them. 
How do you make sure that work helps your new venture move forward to the best of its ability?
Some of this comes from how the customer discovery was conducted. As a reminder:
Entrepreneurs should not outsource customer discovery but rather, should do it personally;
Everyone at the company should be involved / have buy in.
It also comes down to how the customer persona is used after:
Decisions should be made with the customer in mind;
Continue to refer to the person by name. You are selling to this individual, not a nameless customer. Examples:
Amazon has an empty seat in every meeting for the customer
Slack would always base product development on customer feedback
It’s important that your entire team knows who they’re serving. Why? Otherwise you may wind up with different team members having different impressions regarding who is the customer. If different team members think the customer is someone slightly different, then they will create value propositions that don’t match the intended customers’ problems and solutions that don’t deliver the right value propositions.
Alignment on the target customer is crucial to ensure everyone is working towards the same goal. A persona is a simple way to help bolster a common understanding in a startup of who is the target customer. Further, by having a visual nature of the person (i.e. headshot), everyone will clearly see who exactly the team is serving.
Every decision that is made and every feature that is built should tie back to the persona. Let’s use Annie for example. When a decision is being made in regards to product development, etc., a question should always be asked “How would that help Annie?”
Caveat: Brand Permission
If a pre-existing company or entrepreneur plans to launch a new product, brand permission is a critical factor. According to the Yale School of Management “brand permission defines the limits of customers’ willingness to accept a familiar brand name in new marketplace situations.”
If Warby Parker, the eyewear retailer, decided to branch out and sell jewelry, it would be a tenuous link, and obtaining brand permission would require massive investment in branding and customer education. Eyeglasses, sunglasses, or contact lenses are what the customer wants from Warby Parker, not bracelets and necklaces. 
The point here is that customer centricity guides you in future strategy. The questions to ask are “will your customer want this and, if not, what does that mean for your customer relationship?

The Task
The tasks laid out in this article will tell you who your competitors are, what they are doing, how they are doing it, and what effect it will have on your business. Armed with that knowledge, it’s up to you to decide what to do about it.
Note: Analyzing competitors is a long and tedious process. You may wish to augment your team with third-party support. For the cost-conscious: interns are excellent resources for this work. If not interns, UpWork, TopTal, and Catalant offer less-expensive on-demand solutions. As always, the HowDo team and I are here to help you, contact us today. Whichever way you choose, third-party support offers the additional benefit of removing bias from competitor analysis.
The Three Types of Competitor
There are three types of competitors to profile:
Traditional: These are the most obvious competitors. Consequently, they should form the baseline for analysis. Consider this the low watermark—you have to, at least, better your traditional competition to stay above water in the eyes of the customer.
Emerging: These are potential sources of disintermediation in your relationship with your customer. You need to understand your customer’s interplay with the solutions of emerging competitors.
New Market Entrants: Think AirBnB year 2, or Amazon year 4, or Facebook year 3. All of these players were known—or could have been known—to anyone paying attention to venture capitalist chatter. However, as Clayton Christensen so aptly points out, “Disruption” often happens at the bottom of the market, where big businesses do not see an opportunity.
Profiling Your Competitors
This guide will help you to answer the followingquestions regarding your competition:
What products and services do your competitors offer? In the eyes of your customer, in which of these areas do they excel?
What permissions are your customers giving your competition? You need to have the same permissions if you are going to effectively compete.
Has a competitor recently engaged in an acquisition or partnership?
What is the makeup and structure of your competitor’s team?
Who is your competitor hiring? Why?
What processes does your competitor use?
Who are your competitor’s existing and future customers?
How do your competitors measure success?
Is their market share or deal frequency increasing?
Do your competitor’s customers share a demographic, income, or profile with your customers?
The answers to these questions give you a profile of your competitors—a persona. With that persona, you can clearly see how they operate today, and what they may do tomorrow. While you cannot ever predict the future, the better informed you are through data and information, the better your business decisions will be. 
Here is a summary of the step-by-step process (add link)

Conduct a deep dive on high-priority competitors
Share
Deliverables
Your competitor analysis will produce the following four documents:
A Competitor Research Data Document
A Competitor Research Narrative
A List of competitors, cut by classification
A Competitor Product Matrix
Step 1. Identify Your Competitors
The first step in identifying your competitors is to brainstorm with your process team.Most likely,  the most obvious competitors are your traditional competition.
Some of your team may not agree on a competitor, which indicates danger. Almost always, something deemed “not really a competitor” should be included as competition.
Your customer data, which should include competitors identified by your customers, will reveal your emerging competition.
New market entrants can be identified by research and from the sources listed below. Categorize them according to function.
Pitchbook
CBinsights
Crunchbase
F6
Incubator cohorts
NSF startup grant recipients
VC portfoliosSequoia
Social Capital
First Round Capital
Founders Fund
Greylock Partners
Note: It is important to categorize new market entrants by function because many will only affect a single aspect of your business. For example, a competitor may be preventing you from obtaining customer feedback or tracking supply chain errors. The point here is that what may seem to be a small component can quickly grow into a wedge between your firm’s data, you, and the customer experience. You need to identify that component and remove it early. Also, do not forget international competitors. 
Deliverables
This first step will give you a list of your traditional competitors categorized by function. This step will also provide you with a list of new market entrants also categorized by function. Lastly, your customer data will tell you who your customers consider to be your competitors..
Note: Competitors identified by your customers are key data and should be clearly marked.
Step 2. Identify Your Competitor’s Offerings
This step is research-intensive. Below are the key data you need for each competitor.
What products and services do they offer? For each product or service, find out the following:
Pricing
Features
Market penetration
Marketshare
Growth rate
Product history
Has your competitor engaged in any acquisitions or partnerships in the past 10 years?
Deliverables
Step 2 delivers a competitor product matrix. The data on your competitor’s products will be compared with your own products to identify what your products and your company lacks now and might need to develop in the future. The next step, however, is integral to the analysis.
Step 3. Identify Your Competitors’ Operations
You won’t fully understand competitors products without understanding how your competitor operates. This step will provide that information and help you to predict your competitor’s future movements.
Below are the key data to gather.
What is the makeup of your competitor’s teams? Consider the following factors:Size
Education
Function
Management ratio
Who are your competitors looking to hire?
Note: This information can signal the direction your competition is heading. You should track who your competitor hires using sites such as GitHub, Twitter, Medium, LinkedIn, Facebook. These sites can provide insights into what these personnel may have been hired to do.
What processes do your competitors use?
Agile, waterfall, two-pizza teams, etc. 
What is the structure of their organization?
Where do competing products and services exist within the structure?
How does your competitor measure success?
For example, objectives and key results (OKRs) vs. key performance indicators (KPIs)
Key resources for this data are social media pages, quarterly statements, 10-Ks, and press releases.
Note: GitHub, Medium, Twitter, and LinkedIn profiles can tell you a lot about your competitor’s teams’ proficiency with different technologies. Read every quarterly statement and press release for the past two years.
Deliverables
In Step 3, you develop a summary of your competitor’s operations, team proficiency, and possible future strategies. Forewarned is forearmed.
Step 4. Identify Your Competitor’s Customers
This is the most important step when assessing your competitors. All action you take must be based on the customer, and the customer will let you know which competitors to pay the most attention to.
For Step 4, refer to the guide “Building Customer Focus.” This guide outlines the steps to identify your own existing customers and your future customers. Follow the steps in this guide to identify your competitor’s customers. 
Deliverables
In Step 4, you will identify your competitor’s current and potential customers. This data can be compared with your own customer data to help guide your strategy.
Step 5. Conduct a Deep Dive on High-priority Competitors
For most organizations, it will be nearly impossible to do a full breakdown on every competitor. Based on the information gathered above, your team must determine which competitors warrant the time and capital, and then perform exhaustive research.
You need to know as much as you can about your high-priority competitors, but here are key data to gather.
Is the company’s market share rapidly increasing?
Has the company’s deal frequency been increasing?
Do the company’s customers share a demographic profile with your customers? For example, similar income.
Are customers citing similar reasons for leaving your product?
What permissions [add link] are your customers giving your competition? You need to have the same permissions if you are actually going to effectively compete.
Suggested resources for deep dives.
Buy research reports from investment banks (or use leverage with your investors to gain access to these reports).
Conduct bespoke, in-depth research yourself with services like GLG, DMM, and AlphaSights. The best way to extract information is to use single-blind interviews, remain anonymous, and feign ignorance in the entire sector, solution, product, and customer base. It also helps to have a cadre of people in the room scribbling notes, sounding awed, and providing consistent, complimentary feedback. This creates an environment in which the interviewee chooses to divulge the most relevant information. 
If you’re really desperate for data: setup interviews with marquee talent and have them explain their roles in detail. If they rock, hire them! 
Note: While information networks such as GLG, DMM, and AlphaSights are a great source of competitive information for your strategy, your company should institute a policy banning your current employees from these platforms. Your employees may be tempted to leak your information to curious bidders. If you have clogged this hole, bravo! However, the bidders will wait until your employees quit and then harvest your business intelligence for a small fee.
Deliverables
This step, while capital-intensive will provide a Competitor Research Data Document and a Competitor Research Narrative.
These documents represent all you need to know to decide which marquee competitor you want to focus on. There may be a vast array of threats. However, you must prioritize.
Step 6. Share
Remember—disruption is only possible if you are unaware of the assault on your core business. Armed with your deliverables from Steps 1 to 6, you will not be unaware. However, you may choose to dismiss an assault, in which case you are lazy or irresponsible. Presumably, if you have come this far, you will apply what you know to strategy. It’s important to constantly monitor your competitors, and to be ready to pivot at any time. Thus, the next area to consider is your capabilities and your potential to do so.

Example: Big Tech Company Profiles
To provide you with a relevant example of a competitive profile, we profiled Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft – commonly known as “Big Tech” in the US – to help you better understand their market position and how they balance their product portfolio:
Amazon
Amazon is the ultimate representation of the new breed of companies. This company, which started off selling books, has been able to consistently expand into new markets and optimize user journeys. We’ve collected facts and figures that outline how this consumer-centered giant has grown to what it is today. To review Amazon’s company profile, click here.
Apple
Apple has led the hardware market for years. Their product design and proprietary ecosystem has secured them margins seen only in luxury markets with the reach of a consumer product brand. We’ve collected facts and figures to help you understand how they’ve gained this power over the consumer. To review Apple’s company profile, click here.
Facebook
Facebook, with 2+ billion monthly active users, is the largest social media site of all time. This young company, founded in 2004, leverages their network to sell advertising and has cemented its role as Google’s counterpart in the digital advertising “duopoly.” We’ve outlined facts and figures to help you understand how this young company has gotten to where it is today. To review Facebook’s company profile, click here.
Google
Google has developed an amazing business while becoming the infrastructure for the web. The company pulls in ~110 billion dollars in revenue without selling a physical product. We’ve collected facts and figures surrounding Alphabet’s business to help you understand this giant. To review Google’s company profile, click here.
Microsoft
Microsoft has been a market leader for 40 years. Although once more dominant, Microsoft is still a keystone in the digital and internet economy. We’ve collected research to better explain Microsoft’s past and current power. To review Microsoft’s company profile, click here.",2755

Step 1: Identify High-level Trends (Worldwide)
With your team, brainstorm all possible high-level trends occurring throughout the world. After collecting your team’s raw thoughts, connect these trends with recent, verifiable data so that you avoid chasing unnecessary leads. Group the identified trends according to the following eight data categories:
The economic climate
Industry/sector growth
Demographic/social trends
Emerging technology
Regulations/law
Finance/venture capital
Media/pop culture
Consumption
Some examples of high-level trends to explore:
COVID-10 pandemic
Migration to urban areas nearing pre-recession levels (1)
Declining trust in American news media (2, 3)
Increasing student debt (4)
Identifying high-level trends is important because they not only affect your own business, but everything around you, which is the point of context. Zooming out gives you a panoramic view. From there, zoom in on the areas most pertinent to you.
Deliverables
A categorized list of the most significant trends that could be affecting your business now or will be in the future.
Step 2: Identify Trend Impact
The trends listed in your document from Step 1 will affect your firm in different ways depending on the framing. We have identified three general frames of reference that provide significant leverage:
Consumer lifestyle/behavior
Industry
Individual company segments
For each of these lenses, describe how each trend will drive change.
In Step 2, you will begin to see what the future will look for the consumer, your competitors, and your business considering the identified trends. This provides a more accurate context for your business decisions based on data.
Deliverables
Step 2 will produce a list of the general frames that you consider most important with the trends and their anticipated effects listed underneath those general frames.
Step 3: Assign a Value to the Effects That You Identified in Step 2
The effects identified in the document in Step 2 can be opportunities, threats, or both depending on your firm’s position. Using the outputs from your capabilities [link] analysis, compare your firm’s reality to the reality exposed by these trends. For example, how well you can respond to the effects of the identified trends
Assign a value to the effects, ranging from -5 to 5, depending on your firm’s ability to react and capitalize on the trend.
Final Deliverables
This context analysis process will deliver a trend document for all of the trends you have identified. It will document the magnitude of their effect on your business, your competitors, and your customers. You will also better appreciate your company’s ability to react to potential opportunities and threats. It is crucial to undergo this process at regular intervals because your context is always changing.
The goal of this process is to provide you with the knowledge and data that you need to make better business decisions. This process will give you an accurate understanding of your environment and tell you how you should be reacting to it to better serve your customers. Without this knowledge and insight, you are flying blind.",857

A Corollary for Amazon
I learned from corollaries in 2006. At the time, I was charged with building Amazon’s early digital video product. Amazon lacked the technology to ingest, transform, and transmit digital video files. Digital files were a new but critical concept and the only place on earth that routinely worked with digital video files were post-production facilities in Los Angeles. I knew that I had to tap the knowledge and capabilities of GDMX, Technicolor, Deluxe, and Ascent—all the big players in town. These were to be my corollaries.
I met with every single company and had them walk me through how they worked  with digital files and solved problems. I brought all of my findings back to Amazon in Seattle, and I built what Amazon needed based upon what I learned from these experts.  
This knowledge transfer was possible because of Amazon’s incredible influence on the studios and the studios’ influence on the post-production facilities in Los Angeles. As Amazon was a key distributor of studio content back in the days of DVDs, GDMX, Technicolor, Deluxe, and Ascent were more than willing to grant me access to their facilities. I had the opportunity to learn from the best in the business. 
What I’d like to emphasize here is that I didn’t solve the problem, I discovered the solution. I had no idea what I was looking for when I went to Los Angeles, but I knew that the companies I was visiting had surmounted the challenges that Amazon faced. As I toured the facilities and met with the staff, I learned how the companies moved these big files. The staff were the 10X experts, and they made it sound easy. For them, digital files had been foundational for years. For me, I found solutions that would have taken me months to discover otherwise.
People are often excited to share their expertise. I’ve found that if you show interest in what people do, they’re more than happy to answer your questions. Not only does this help you to solve your own problems, it builds invaluable relationships and even partnerships.
For a company to evolve and reach the next level, it must overcome its hindrances, and it behooves the company to do so in the most efficient way possible. Evolution then, in its most practical sense, means either learning from experts, hiring an expert who can find the solution; licensing or renting a solution; or acquiring the technology that is the solution. 
Corollaries on a Larger Scale
In September 2016, Walmart bought Jet in an attempt to boost its e-commerce operations and to become more competitive with Amazon and its e-commerce empire. Jet was an established but largely unprofitable e-commerce platform with the technology and networks that Walmart lacked. 
In February 2020, Salesforce bought Velocity for $1.3 billion because it wanted Velocity’s industry-specific CRM solutions. Velocity gave Salesforce visibility among the industries that Salesforce had not yet penetrated: communications, government, health, insurance, media, and utility companies. 
In January 2020, AMN Healthcare bought Stratus Video for $475 million to get its hands on the company’s video-based language interpretation software. The remote video link allowed medical professionals to communicate with non-English-speaking patients, and this capability was federally mandated for the healthcare industry. 
These are examples of heavy hitters who didn’t mess around reinventing already proven solutions. The problems these companies faced had been solved by others before, so these companies simply acquired the entities that had the solutions. 
Evolving companies need to find the shortest possible way to fill gaps in their capabilities. In Walmart’s case, it was software that could build them a competitive e-commerce platform. In Salesforce’s case, it was a CRM solution that would allow them entry into certain industries. The solutions already existed, the companies just acquired them in the most convenient and cost-efficient way.
A lot of companies indulge themselves and think that they need to solve problems for the first time. They think that their problems are unique and that no one has encountered the problem before. In my experience, a cursory review of business history and a review of a company’s environment, what I call an analysis of the business context, will reveal that a similar problem has been an issue before and has most likely already been solved. So, why do it again?
Evolving as a business requires seeking the best solution, no matter where it comes from. If you can find the basic elements of the problem and look to industries that have already solved that basic element, you significantly accelerate your learning and reduce your risk.
The “Adjacent Possible”
The “adjacent possible” is a term coined by scientist Stuart Kauffman. Kauffman was particularly interested in biological evolution, the origins of order, and the mechanisms that drive self-organization. His findings are often applied to business and technology concepts to describe how one idea can lead to other concepts and ideas, or how the actual expands into the adjacent possible. The actual is a system’s current state, with all its components and interconnections, andthe adjacent possible is external elements that could be opportunities for expansion by building new connections and turning those elements into system components.
The iPhone is a famous example of a breakthrough that occurred when previous concepts were linked according to the adjacent possible theory.
To start with, the first touchscreen was patented in 1975 and was designed for air traffic control by E.A. Johnson. Meanwhile, the University of Illinois was developing touchscreen terminals for students. The first commercial touchscreen computer came out in 1983, and Casio released a touchscreen pocket computer in 1987. 
The iPod, a digital music player, built upon the work of Kane Kramer who was inspired by the Sony Walkman that emerged in the 1970s. Kramer came up with the IXI, and pitched it as a digital tool that could deliver music, catalogue content, promote artists, and conduct microtransactions. Obvious functions that would later characterize the iPhone of 2007.
Steve Jobs asked his engineers at Apple to focus on applying touchscreen devices to tablet computers, which created the iPad. Jobs insightfully believed that phones were going to become portable information tools, so he focused on the iPod and developed iTunes software to synchronize content with the iPod device. iTunes was released in January 2001.
On September 7, 2005, Apple and Motorola collaborated to develop the Motorola ROKR E1, the first mobile phone to use iTunes. Jobs was unhappy with the ROKR because he believed that compromising with a non-Apple designer (Motorola) had prevented Apple from designing the phone they really wanted to make.
Jobs wanted an exclusive Apple design and, in 2006, Apple discontinued support for the ROKR and released a new version of iTunes that was to be used with the soon to be launched iPhone 2G.
Steve Jobs stood on the shoulders of the many unseen giants—engineers, students, and scientists— who had built the technology he drew upon. Jobs solved problems and created new products by seeking out those who had done similar work before and linking ideas. He found the experts and learned from them. 
Many companies, such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, or Microsoft, use 10X engineers to build upon their concepts. 10X engineers are extremely brilliant people, but they are also people who have simply solved many problems before. They are, therefore, worth 10 times as much because their expertise makes them 10 times quicker.  
An engineer who knows how to make Google’s infrastructure and algorithms work is extremely smart and has failed over and over again on the journey. Because they have failed so much, a company that hires them is buying the absence of failure. Even if success is not immediate, a company that hires a 10X-er is at least starting with a leg up and a strong foundation. If a company hires experts, it can stand on the shoulders of giants
Corollaries are essential elements of rapid and accelerated evolution, and corollaries reduce risk. With corollaries, you can be a fast-follow company with a 70 percent chance of success rather than a company that goes first with an 80 percent chance of failure.
First Mover Vs. Fast Follower
Being a fast follower rather than a first mover gives companies the benefit of hindsight. Ron Stein, the founder of FastPath Marketing and More Customers Academy, offers words of caution to companies who seek first-mover advantage. According to Stein, the strategy might work if you have a potential disruptive concept, but that is rarely the case. Instead, it is less risky to wait, watch the first movers, and fill in the holes evident in their products. 
Sony’s video cassette playback device, Betamax, launched in 1974, is an example of a first-mover product that worked. However, it worked because no one could match the technology for a long time, says Stein. 
Video Home System (VHS) watched the success of Betamax while also learning from the consumer response to home entertainment. VHS discovered two important facts, that consumers wanted home entertainment and feature length Hollywood movies, which Sony could not deliver with Betamax. By 1980, VHS had 60 percent of the North American market, and Betamax was toast.
First movers often find themselves stuck in quicksand, unable to respond quickly to market demand, which allows competitors to catch them up. Today, although technology is advancing, there is rarely a company that is so far ahead in an area that the first-mover advantage is enough to outweigh the risk. 
First movers have to educate the market. When there is no market validation, there is greater risk. First movers typically have high capital expenses because they are blazing the trail. Agile processes, developing minimum viable products, and trial-and-error learning can be costly. 
For a company that enters the market later, there is less groundwork to cover, and there is an opportunity to improve on the first-mover’s product. What does the product lack? How was it received by the consumer? Can the product be improved? How quickly can a better version be brought to market?
Google was a fast follower of Yahoo, which was the main player in the search engine domain when Google launched. Facebook was a follower in the wake of Myspace, Hi5, and Orkut. McDonalds was a follower after White Castle, which was founded in 1921. McDonalds learned from White Castle and was the first restaurant to introduce the assembly-line system when they opened a redesigned restaurant in 1948, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s, Carl’s Jr., KFC, and Jack in the Box were all fast-food fast followers after McDonalds, although none have managed to topple McDonalds from the top spot.
Misplaced Biases
There is a well-known problem called not invented here syndrome (NIHS), a costly form of innovation snobbery. With NIHS, a company might reject a perfectly acceptable existing solution purely because it is not their own. The trouble here is that there is no reason to believe that a solution developed in-house would be any better than the solution that already exists on the market.
The mindset of NIHS reminds me of a “fixie” bike, a single-speed bicycle with no brakes favored by the hipster. Where is the logic? Bikes have brakes and clutches for a reason, for safety and as aids when going up and down hill. Gears and brakes are valuable engineering concepts. In the case of a bike, they allow the rider to gracefully stop at the bottom of a hill without the pedals flinging their legs around a million miles per hour crescendoed by a launch over the handlebars.
Please, embrace existing solutions. You can and should peer up and over your own box, whatever your innovation prowess. It’s not normal or advisable to dismiss brakes that keep you from flipping over a bike or sliding out of control. It’s not necessary to huff and puff as you go up a hill or hold on for dear life as you go down. 
Part of the problem with NIHS is observation bias. We think and act in certain ways, some of which are terribly unproductive. We look for familiar patterns and keep to things we know because it’s simpler. But the future of work, the future of strategy, the future of being a manager, and the future of creating a product is the opposite of that. The future requires seeking the best solution no matter where it originates or how paradoxical it may seem.
Finding a Corollary
How do you find a corollary? First, you need to define your problem. Once you have defined your problem, the right corollary will become clear. Do you need to appeal to a different demographic? Then, find an expert in that demographic and bring them on board. Do you need to move down market and reduce the cost of goods sold? Then, find someone who either works down market and understands the supply chain and the parameters of your product or partner with a manufacturer already established downstream.
Additionally, when defining the problem, pick the one with the most leverage, meaning, get to the root of the problem. 
For example, consider the Gillette razor. Let’s assume that consumers are choosing a competitor razor causing Gillette to lose market share. The competitor product is slightly more expensive, and the competitor is spending more on branding to educate the consumer on its product. Could the Gillette razor’s price point be lowered to undercut competitors? Maybe. So let’s look at the cost of goods sold (COGS) for the Gillette razor. 
The parts include the battery, the five blades, a smoothing strip, a moistening strip, and every bell and whistle you could imagine attached to a razor. If Gillette simplifies the razor, the supply chain will change because a newer simpler model no longer needs the advanced technology of the more complicated model. So, it might be possible to find a simpler product at a lower price point with a different manufacturer, but is that the real problem?
You also need to consider consequential and intangible factors such as the reliability of the current supply chain, distribution, storage, shipping, and marketing. COGS broadly is an analysis in and of itself, and it is imprecise. In addition to COGS, has the analysis really dug into the root of the problem. Is the price point the real problem in this case? It might be that the competitor is developing a better relationship with customers and their education branding is paying off. The problem might have nothing at all to do with price and COGS.
Without defining the core problem, Gillette risks falling down a rabbit hole. Gillette might unnecessarily develop a simpler product that would not help their sales and might disrupt an otherwise functioning supply chain. But looking at corollaries in terms of their competitor might reveal that rebranding would be a better strategy. 
The Five Whys
The Lean/Six Sigma space uses a process called “The Five Whys” to whittle a problem down to its root cause. The process is simple: start with a problem statement and continue to ask “Why?” until you get to the root of the problem. Taiichi Ohno, father of the Toyota Production System, explains:
“The basis of Toyota’s scientific approach is to ask why five times whenever we find a problem … By repeating why five times, the nature of the problem as well as its solution becomes clear.“ 
Problem Statement: Customers are unhappy because they are being shipped products that don’t meet their specifications.

1. Why are customers being shipped bad products?
– Because manufacturing built the products to a specification that is different from what the customer and the sales person agreed to.

2. Why did manufacturing build the products to a different specification than that of sales?
– Because the sales person expedites work on the shop floor by calling the head of manufacturing directly to begin work. An error happened when the specifications were being communicated or written down.
3. Why does the sales person call the head of manufacturing directly to start work instead of following the procedure established in the company?
– Because the “start work” form requires the sales director’s approval before work can begin and slows the manufacturing process (or stops it when the director is out of the office).

4. Why does the form contain an approval for the sales director?
– Because the sales director needs to be continually updated on sales for discussions with the CEO.”
Once you have found the root cause, you can identify the options to explore. Depending on the problem and the situation, it may be a software solution, a process solution, or a solution that requires bringing in external experts have faced similar problems in the past.
Where Corollaries Meet Confrontation
Even if you find a corollary, it’s still an uphill battle to implement the solution. In my career, a common problem is what I describe as “the body rejecting the organ.” You bring in a new truth to an organization and there’s so much orthodoxy, so much rigidity around the current truth, that the new truth is disruptive. The new truth challenges people so much that it starts to detract value in the near term because people feel threatened by the disruption and the new perspective. Instead of trying to understand or learn the truth, they try to rid the company of the idea.  
So, why do people feel threatened by change? Because people are afraid to fail. When confronted with a solution to a problem, some will feel that it is something that they cannot understand well enough to demonstrate proficiency. The dynamic is directly tied to personal worth. A lack of understanding is linked to obsolescence, or that they may be considered too old to understand a new idea, or their skill set is out of date. Call it insecurity, if you will. 
It’s okay to not understand everything in business—anyone who acts like they do is pretending. What is important is that leaders constantly try to learn rather than remain in the small corner of the world where they built their career. 
The Steps in Applying Corollaries
In the HowDo guide to corollaries, I lay out a step-by-step approach to identifying problems and the corollaries with the fastest and most risk-free solutions. Broadly speaking, the steps are the following:
Identify the problem to solve.
Find out if the problem has been solved before.
If the problem has been solved before, who solved it? Experts, teams, labs?
Search for pre-built solutions.
Identify the corollaries that would make the most impact or provide the best opportunities.
Investigate the capital required.
Investigate the time until return on income (ROI).
Hire or contract experts who have solved the problem before.
Leverage expert networks to contact experts at competitor companies. 
Learn how the experts solved the problem.
Apply the solution.
Finding the 10x Employee
If you want to solve a problem quickly, you’re going to have to find and acquire those who have solved it before. Sometimes it will be an expert, sometimes it will be an entire team, or even an entire company. It might be a hard pill to swallow given internal bias, but the future will be filled with more of these conversations, so proudly accept corollaries as an addition to your toolbox. 
In my career, the correct expert has an outsized ROI. What I mean by that is that they increase the probability of success, decrease the amount of time required for success, and increase your confidence that you will achieve success. The correct expert comes with all of the learning amassed from the mistakes they’ve made solving the same problem in the past. This is a shortcut around all of the blunders that a less experienced person might encounter, and it is why the right expert does not come cheap.
In Silicon Valley, you have “10X engineer,” so-called because this is a person who is 10 times more productive than everyone else, super human in fact. Some of them are actual geniuses in their field and probably started building neural networks when they were five. But the majority of them are simply just deeply familiar with the problem and have the battle scars to prove it. 
Familiarity is accumulated by being thrown head first into a problem. How do you build a tracking algorithm at Facebook? No clue—let’s find out! Facebook has made a ton of mistakes learning how to target people with algorithms. Thus, hire someone who has worked at Facebook and your consumer algorithms will knock it out of the park.
Finding these experts can be tricky but, for most sectors, LinkedIn provides some transparency to who is doing what. Many people advertise exactly what they want to do and what exactly they are doing. Start with your competitors, and call the people who have solved the problem. If you cannot afford them, look down or across from that competitor. If you can’t afford the person from Facebook, look to Pinterest, Tinder, or any of the other private networks. Look to employees who used to work for Facebook or Instagram and went to startups, failed, or otherwise.
Traditional companies underestimate their appeal to many potential employees. Many high-fliers think that they want to build the future in an open floor plan with unlimited Blue Bottle coffee, but the appeal of startups can soon wane. Many decide they want health insurance not an espresso every two hours. A stable income, stock options, weekends, and evenings are conducive to sanity, 80 hour weeks are not. Find these people, and make a pitch. You might be pleasantly surprised.
At Rosetta Stone, my team was building a better language learning product. My corollaries in this case were the academics that taught language learning. I researched the most cited and most awarded and most acknowledged academics, and I hired them. I also found who was producing the best product, the fastest growing product, the product with the most customer satisfaction and hired them. I identified the best technology platform for our purposes and bought it. I found out who was the leader in app development and market penetration for kids and hired them. I dissected the problems that we needed to solve, and the company created room in the P&L to get the right people. 
The result? Rosetta Stone won iKids awards for our kids apps. The B2B platform we built is now the primary P&L for the company. We went from a B2C company to a B2B company with one or two acquisitions and some new teams. We completely changed the company with precision solutions to problems that we could see were making money. We combined assets that allowed us to squeeze out efficiencies.
I solved no problems myself, I found people who could. I used corollaries to drive growth.",4804

All innovation requires capital. For large corporations not used to innovating, finding, defending and scaling this capital is extremely difficult. This article explores how the allocation of resources and the organization of innovation financing can support a large company’s innovation. With a new budgeting framework and finance practices you can position your existing business and new idea for innovation success.

Balancing finance and innovation Innovation accounting
Balancing Finance and Innovation
“We’re in a period of incredible change in how you fund innovation, especially entrepreneurial innovation”
— Ethan Mollick, Professor of Management Science at the Wharton School, 2012
Finance and innovation have a tempestuous relationship, partly because one espouses discipline and rules and the other wants to transcend norms and boundaries. And, within this contentious union, the finance department is the gatekeeper of a modern company’s strategic direction – or at least its pecuniary resources.
Irrespective of whether an idea offers future market dominance conceptually, the immediate decision to pursue it is almost always made with the following financial question in mind: “How will this affect next quarter’s earnings?”
This is a nearsighted perspective, necessary when keeping to budgets but not conducive to long-term innovation activities. The perspective is a result of governance. CEOs are often pressured to please the shareholders in the short term rather than dig in and plan for a more secure and successful future.
In the finance department, CFOs struggle to commit to long-term innovation funding in this governance context as they study quarterly balance sheets and feel the heat. Compounding the limitations are antiquated legacy tools that have been in use for years to assess ongoing projects with ill-fitting metrics; the finance department has been a back-office function, but it needs to be brought into the modern digital age.
For a company to improve, change, and innovate over time, the finance department needs to be along for the ride. And since the finance department controls the resources necessary for innovation success, a formula that quantifies innovation efforts in a way that keeps both the visionaries and the shareholders happy could be the answer. Is it possible, then, for the risk-averse finance contingent to support the risk-oriented innovation pioneers?
Innovation – Who Does It and Who Pays for It?
When looking at operational spending, it’s easy to focus on cost-cutting and efficiency. After all, efficiency is what boosts the bottom line. It’s also a guarantee that if a cheaper raw material can be used or supply chain kinks can be ironed out, cost savings will boost earnings to the delight of analysts and investors.
But what’s not so easy is allocating resources to future improvements and innovations that have no tangibility or guarantee whatsoever. Planning for the future is always a thought, but how does it translate to the operating budget?
Brad Power, a management consultant in process innovation, and Steve Stanton, co-founder of FCB Partners, created a framework showing choices leaders have when it comes to allocating resources for innovation (Figure 1).

Source:  FCB Partners via Harvard Business Review , 2014
Power and Stanton illustrate that disruptive innovation takes autonomous units, incubators, and venture funding for experimentation. Innovation for the future requires collaboration from many directions. For example, public relations need to be addressed in the age of digital communications and mobile culture; HR management requires a whole new approach that focuses on the employee experience. Resources, then, must be allocated for the pursuit of new value networks, partners, and customers.
Power and Stanton also polled managers from various industries to find out how they were currently allocating resources for innovation. They found that most managers wanted to spend less on day-to-day operations and double the amount spent on big, disruptive innovations.
Leaders are clear that there is a need to invest in the future, but they are unclear as to where exactly to deposit those innovation funds. Who exactly is doing the innovating? Which department is responsible for the expenses?
Innovation Spending on R&D
There is a belief among some in the C-Suite that R&D is responsible for innovation.  But the relationship is more complicated. Recent data show that the connection between R&D spending and innovation, or lack thereof, has no statistical relationship with common growth metrics.
The 2016 “Global Innovation 1000” study by PwC Strategy shows that the ten most innovative companies outperformed the top ten R&D spenders, which refutes traditional theory and past research studies. The study points to the rise of economic nationalism, an inward-looking, domestic, and isolationist approach to growth, as a movement that has thrown the world of innovation into uncertainty.
To illustrate, data from Stratey& and PWC shows that Apple and Alphabet continue to lead the most innovative list, followed by 3M and Tesla; however, the companies that spent the most on R&D were Volkswagen, Samson Electronics, and Amazon. Apple spent $8.1 billion on R&D, outperforming Volkswagen in innovation, which spent a colossal $13.2 billion.  3M spent just $1.8 billion on R&D and outperformed Samsung, which spent close to $13 billion.
While it is true that many Fortune 500 companies have found success while funding robust R&D programs to compete in industries dominated by physical products, conducting great R&D and achieving market success with inventions and technologies are two different things.
Artificial intelligence, for example, was invented back in 1992 when Yann Lecun, a computer scientist, built a computer chip called ANNA, a play on the term “artificial neural network.” But it wasn’t until recently that the technology was developed further, using deep neural networks to perform tasks that can be applied in today’s digital environment, such as facial recognition or language translation.
Thus, an invention is all well and good. To be profitable, however, it must have two additional components – customer value and a business model – and all three components need investment and management. We go deeper into this relationship in our guide on research and development.
“Innovation = invention + customer value + a business model.”
— Tendayi Viki, Managing Partner at Benneli Jacobs, 2016
Figure 2: R&D Spending Versus Financial Performance
Expand
Source:  PwC , 2016
Figure 2, taken from Strategy& and PWC’s 2016 Global Innovation 1000, when loosely interpreted, shows that companies that invested more in R&D did not necessarily see better sales growth. If the traditional pairing of R&D investment and innovation is no longer a path to guaranteed innovation, what is?
A Separate Innovation Budget and New Partnerships
“One of the biggest problems with not having an obvious innovation head is the use of funds for innovation projects can be a little disorganized. ”
–— Michael Fitzgerald, Senior Analyst, Celent
Clay Christensen, professor at Harvard Business School, Author of “The Innovator’s Dilemma,” discusses disruption in the finance sector in an interview with Aria Lewis of Barclays Bank. The world-renowned innovative thinker explains disruption and, in some cases, how its effect is to slow growth in the short term. Christensen specifically explains how accounting cannot account for this slow growth because the discipline uses traditional metrics – yet this slowing is a necessary part of the long-term innovation process.
In many organizations, there is no clear or single department that “owns” innovation. This lack of ownership has led some companies to create a separate budget solely to fund innovation over the long term and, in some cases, to avoid pilfering from other business areas. A survey by Celent found that almost 70 percent of innovation program leaders said they allocated funds from the technology budget to cover innovation costs. A 2017 Harvey Nash / KPMG CIO Survey found that only around 30 percent of organizations are fostering innovation by funding innovation separately.
The big companies take innovation seriously and allocate appropriate resources to an independent department to achieve a long-term focus. If innovation is done piecemeal, by taking resources from other business areas, the limitations stifle creativity.
“Go ahead and do the math on your current allocation; you’ll likely find that more than 90% of your resources are devoted to keeping the lights on.”
— Brad Power, management consultant in process innovation, and Steve Stanton, co-founder of FCB Partners
A separate innovation budget protects long-term projects and frees those involved to pursue creative avenues.
According to Power and Stanton, leading IT organizations manage their budgets with three “buckets”: operations, maintenance, and innovation. These firms try to reduce their spending on operations and maintenance from 90 to 60 percent so that the remaining 30 percent can go toward innovation.
Jeremiah Owyang, Founder of Crowd Companies in Silicon Valley, also points to the need for innovation leaders to have a dedicated budget to fund long-term innovation activities rather than having to tie programs with business metrics and ROI.
Startup Partnerships for New Ventures
As industry has transitioned into the digital age, firms are increasingly trying to innovate by creating fast, independent teams to directly address consumer needs. Startups dominate the world of agility and consumer-focused ventures. With agile business models and a customer-oriented approach, startups epitomize the new innovation model of Viki (2016).
Innovation = invention + customer value + a business model.
Moreover, the digital economy has allowed startups to rapidly expand and disrupt incumbents, and successful corporations are interacting with these startups to gain access to talent and ideas, and to gain insights into innovative culture.
Nestlé, for example is committed to working with startups Nestlé is committed to working with startups. Gerardo Mazzeo, global innovation director and CSV manager at Nestlé, told Bryce Wilcock of BQ of the company’s efforts to working with start-ups to bring more products to market. A dedicated budget allows for more “bleeding-edge” initiatives. Which begs the question: have market leaders such as Nestlé benefited from innovation spending and partnership efforts?
In 2016, Nestlé announced a joint venture with R&R, a leading ice cream company based in the United Kingdom. The venture offers products, including those from Nestlé’s European frozen food business, in Europe, the Middle East (excluding Israel), Argentina, Australia, Brazil, the Philippines, and South Africa and chilled dairy business in the Philippines. Nestlé has gained R&R’s competitive manufacturing model and significant presence in retail.
More bleeding-edge projects for Nestlé include a new partnership with Rabobank and RocketSpace for the Terra Food + Agtech Accelerator. The venture will select and coach some of the most innovative and disruptive startups in the food and agricultural industry to create healthier and more sustainable food products.
PayPal is another example of a company forging partnerships and disrupting a major industry. It aced a power play opportunity and a partnership with Apple in July 2017 when PayPal became a payment option in Apple’s services. According to Caitlin Huston, report for MarketWatch, the partnership will give consumers another payment option when transacting with Apple – an example of a “consumer-choice” approach.
Granted, Apple is arguably not a startup, but PayPal has that space covered, too. In 2017, PayPal announced that it had picked five young fintech startups for its incubation program in Chennai, India. While the startups get access to PayPal’s tech infrastructure, network, and team, PayPal gets a footing and exposure in the burgeoning Indian mobile payments market. Practically anything PayPal touches turns to gold, so their model is not a bad one to follow.
The point made here is that innovation should be a business department all its own, with a budget dedicated to resources, building partnerships, and taking risks. As with any opinion, however, there are dissenters.
Adi Gaskell, contributor to Innocentive, suggests that a separate innovation department will be too isolated because the perspectives from individuals throughout an organization are required. She suggests an ambidextrous approach where separate innovation teams work alongside “business-as-usual” teams to maximize opportunities for creative input. Gaskell states that even with a separate innovation department, other flexible and temporary teams will be created for new projects. Her idea, then, is to use the “power center” that already exists in an organization –  the group or product that attracts the talent or that delivers profits – as the anchor for innovation activities.
Whatever model a company chooses, there will be struggles. But being aware of the pitfalls of each path is the first step to enabling change and improvement.
 internal innovation can support company goals.
Old Metrics Don’t Translate to New Products
“At its core, the Finance 2020 organization will continue to protect the integrity of the enterprise and reduce costs. That will never change. What will change is that Finance 2020 will become the value creation center of tomorrow’s digital business.”
— Accenture, Finance 2020, 2015
As with any other business activity, companies need to track the success of their investments and ROI. When it comes to innovation investments, many companies apply the same financial metrics as they do to their core business investments. One example is the “balanced scorecard” approach developed by Robert S. Kaplan, senior fellow and the Marvin Bower Professor of Leadership Development at Harvard Business School, and David P. Norton, founder and director of the Palladium Group.
The approach begins by identifying what is important for the overall success of the company (ROI, reputation for excellence, growth in market share, etc.) and deriving measurable activities that reflect these goals. The activities are plotted as a spider diagram displaying the relative strengths and weaknesses across these activities.
Typical categories include general management, research and technical staff, financial management, customer satisfaction, outreach activities, communication of services, and self-assessment. The trouble is that these metrics are often narrowly focused on short-term results and aren’t conducive to the long-term fostering of intangible creativity that is so crucial for innovation.
In an empirical study presented at the 2013 MIT Asia Conference in Accounting, researchers examined the impact of accounting conservatism on corporate innovation. The authors concluded that the problems that conservatism creates have an overall stifling effect on creative efforts:
A combination of asymmetric treatment of non-R&D activities and managerial myopia hinders innovation.
Managers often cut R&D investment to meet earnings reporting.
Firms are more likely to miss pre-determined targets because accounting conservatism stymies innovation.
Fewer patents and patent citations imply less innovation.
Cash flows are reduced and have shorter horizons.
Not surprisingly, according to the study, these negative effects are more pronounced when CEO compensation is tied to company growth and financial performance, when managers are myopic and focused on short-term profits, when firms operate in innovative industries, and when accrual manipulation (deferring expenses to meet quarterly expectations, for example) is more difficult.
Innovation Accounting – a Saner Approach
Innovation accounting defines and measures the progress of innovation, such as customer retention and usage patterns for new products or business units. Traditional accounting, on the other hand, when applied to innovation, stifles the progress of the product or business unit.
Traditional accounting tends to assume that a product is already established with revenue and accompanying expenses while new products or startups have no revenue and burn resources. Few innovation ventures stand up to scrutiny based on financial ratios or cash-flow analysis.
Eric Ries is an entrepreneur and author of “The Lean Startup.” In a video interview, he discusses his concept of innovation accounting. Ries explains that innovation accounting is designed specifically for startups, although all organizations should apply it to innovation efforts. It quantifies progress and validates learning using new metrics, not traditional ones.
Steve Glaveski, CEO and co-founder of Collective Campus, explains why traditional metrics don’t work when it comes to evaluating innovation. According to Glaveski, companies should ask themselves the following questions before pinning down new types of metrics:
Does an idea have the potential to disrupt or is it a low-risk, low-reward incremental improvement?
Are customers overserved or underserved by existing solutions?
Does the idea solve a problem?
Can we build it?
How steep is the competition?
Has it been done before, and what were the results?
Can we test it quickly, economically, and effectively using our existing networks and ability to prototype?
Galveski’s point is that posing these questions for each innovation and rating them as far as risk is concerned is far more relevant and purposeful than going with the following statement: “We expect this new innovation to generate 5% of our revenue growth target for the year and if it doesn’t within 6 months we’ll can it.”
Jeremiah Owyang, Founder of Catalyst Companies, finds that the most common metric attached to innovation program success is increased revenue. But ROI, he says, if measured too soon and before an innovation kicks in, is a fallacy.
Digital Transformation in Finance
“Technology is changing so rapidly and arriving so fast, there is a certain motivation to be cautious and take a waitand-see approach. You might think, ‘I’m going to be smart and sit back a little bit and see what happens before I make a decision.’ The problem is that the change is so significant and the new capabilities so advantageous, that if you take a wait-and-see approach, you run the risk of being put at a severe competitive disadvantage.”
— Tony Kilmas, EY Global Finance Performance Improvement Advisory Leader
The finance department is the “gatekeeper” to funding for every organizational department. And in this digitally charged world, companies need to bring their finance and accounting systems into the digital era.
Digital transformation of finance and accounting means that the cloud allows clients and accountants to work from the same files, which saves time and work. Mobile apps can integrate accounting software with retailer points of sale, send contractor quotes, or provide practically any other type of function a business needs. Real-time decisions can be based on data and forecasts from digital solutions. Artificial intelligence makes accounting software smarter – finding trends and identifying the most profitable business areas.
In a white paper, PwC suggests five pillars for integrating digital financing solutions into the front office:
Collaboration and team communication. Digital tools for real-time communication between virtual teams anywhere in the world are more important that a focus on technical finance skills.
A digital workforce using software robotics should replace time-consuming manual processes.
Data and analytics using big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning provide insight generation.
Agility from cloud computing and software-as-a-service (SaaS) gives businesses and startups access to tools and enterprise resource planning at far lower costs.
Cyber security through a digital CFO can proactively address security threats.
Workforce Upskilling – from Microsoft Excel to Hadoop
In addition to a digital workforce composed of software solutions, finance staff need a different skill set, even if SaaS or outsourcing is doing much of the work. Tech-savvy, digitally versed workers are the new in-demand demographic. Data scientists who are proficient in Hadoop, Oracle, and big-data-oriented computer languages such as Scala will become exceedingly hard to find.
At a time when cyber threats are increasing exponentially, the demand for security analysts to thwart them is rocketing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the percent change in employment or security analysts from 2016 to 2026 is expected to be 28 percent. Compare that to the average change expected for all occupations at 7 percent.
Analysts will be required to parse big data from machine learning tools; employees that understand the SaaS model and the private, public, and hybrid cloud environment will shoulder the responsibility of integrating new systems with existing infrastructure. Firms will need talent to integrate artificial intelligence, virtual reality, the Internet of Things, and new platforms, tools, and languages to advance their automation and DevOps.
But have we jumped ahead of ourselves on the technology front?
A 2017 report by Robert Halfand the Financial Executives Research Foundation collected responses from over 1,400 financial leaders in the United States and Canada to assess the performance and state of accounting and finance functions. The study found that almost 70 percent of U.S. executives surveyed said that they continue to use Microsoft Excel as their primary budgeting and planning tool, which marks an increase from the previous year.
Why are companies clinging to legacy systems and trusted steeds such as Microsoft Excel? Traditional software such as Excel is creating a drag on digital transition; at a time when companies need to be more nimble, clunky infrastructure holds things back.
According to Joe McKenrick, author and independent analyst, the authors of an IFS study jokingly conclude that enterprise resource planning (ERP) really stands for “Excel Runs Production” because of a reluctance among finance departments to stop using spreadsheets. Companies are delaying investing in specialized tools because of the costs associated with implementing them and the difficulties involved in fulfilling individual project and department requirements.
The truth is that it is costlier not to embrace digital. Legacy or outdated systems take more time and impose greater risk. For example, spreadsheets need to be reworked, employees need to learn how to work around Excel constraints, there are more errors (sometimes up to almost 90 percent), broken links, and susceptibility to fraud.
“Corporate analytics teams have reached the extremes of Excel… Excel tasks will be done elsewhere such as in analytics platforms and cloud-based modeling tools.”
— Ian Bennett, FPA, Acuity, 2016
According to Philip Howard, research director at European IT consultancy Bloor Research, Excel is so limiting to organizations that modeling training for the software is less about how to use its advanced features and more about helping analysts cope with its constraints, particularly when finance departments resort to solutions such as ClusterSeven, a cloud-based spreadsheet manager. The problems with ClusterSeven, for example, are that there is no audit capability, no control over changes, and data analysis is unwieldy.
Digital solutions are fast and cost-effective. What’s more, they provide the infrastructure for tomorrow’s technology and prepare financial operations for the next evolution. Not digitally transforming means slowing down financing, budgeting, accounting, and the overall innovativeness of an organization.
New solutions such as Tagetik, Adaptive Insights, and Anaplan are intelligent systems. Rather than hamper creativity, they can supplement or replace Excel, provide real-time reporting and business forecasting, and perform tasks that spawn optimal business decisions based on big data for future innovation.
Companies need to be ready for the next technological movement with the right infrastructure. Blockchain is another disruptor that portends change in every aspect of our future. It has the potential to disrupt global trade, global financing, and global supply chain management, among others. It reinvents the basic building block of commerce. According to David Meyer, contributor to Fortune, the ledger is recording transactions at lightning speed, driving major banks such as Barclays, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Credit Suisse, HSBC, MUFG, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce to experiment with blockchain.
Change is just not an option if a company wants to nurture innovation and stay relevant. Combining wisely chosen solutions with a workforce that can optimize them supports innovation efforts.

Introduction to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
""What gets measured gets managed."" - Peter Drucker, Austrian-American management consultant, educator, and author
In an era where data is abundant, the challenge for businesses isn't about gathering data, but rather, identifying which data matters most. This section delves into Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), metrics that serve as the pulse of your organization, to guide decision-making and strategy.
How do you sift through the noise and focus on what truly drives your business? This section aims to unravel the intricacies of KPIs and offers you the necessary tools to harness their transformative power. In it we’ll cover:
Choosing the Right KPIs: It is essential that you define KPIs that mirror your business. We'll guide you through the process, ensuring alignment with your core values and goals.
Measuring and Monitoring: Tracking KPIs is an ongoing process. We'll delve into the methodologies to keep your finger on the pulse, adjusting as your business evolves.
Turning KPIs into Action: KPIs are not an end but a means to an end. We'll show you how to use KPIs to translate these numbers into actions that propel your organization forward.
Defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are quantifiable measures used to gauge the success of an organization, team, or individual in achieving specific objectives. In modern businesses, they are essential tools for tracking progress towards specific goals and informing decision-making processes and strategies. Let's break down the term:
The term ""Key"" signifies the metric's importance—it's not just any metric, but one that holds significant weight in evaluating your business.
""Performance"" relates directly to how your business operates. It's about outcomes—whether your business is generating revenue, making a profit, satisfying customers, empowering employees, delivering upon its marketing promises, operating efficiently, continuously improving or ensuring cash flow.
""Indicator"" relates to a clear, quantifiable metric that gives you insight into how your business is doing. By understanding and monitoring your KPIs, you gain a clear perspective on the health and trajectory of your business. This knowledge ensures you're making informed decisions that bolster your business' growth and sustainability.
Types of KPIs
Please note: For additional examples of KPIs, along with a detailed description, corresponding benefits and the formula needed to calculate specific data, please see the Example KPI Index at the bottom of this Masterclass.
Financial KPIs:
Financial KPIs offer a strategic insight into your business's financial health. They enable you to assess performance, identify trends, and make decisions aligned with your financial goals, ensuring that your strategies resonate with your long-term vision.
Sales KPIs:
These metrics delve into the core of your revenue generation. Sales KPIs allow you to gain insights into what's working and where improvements are needed, which contributes to a growth-oriented approach, by ensuring that your sales strategies harmonize with your overall objectives.
Marketing KPIs:
The voice of your business requires careful measurement. By tracking specific marketing KPIs, you can evaluate campaign success, refine messaging, and ensure that your marketing efforts truly connect with your customer, building brand equity and loyalty.
Operational KPIs:
Efficiency is paramount in delivering value. Operational KPIs provide a lens to examine your business processes, allowing for necessary adjustments to meet goals. This alignment ensures smooth operation and consistency in delivering quality products and services.
Product KPIs:
Understanding product or service performance is essential. Product KPIs allow you to gauge customer satisfaction, identify innovation opportunities, and align your offerings with market demands, creating a product line that resonates with what your customers truly need.
Employee Satisfaction Score (ESAT):
Reflecting the pulse of your organization, ESAT measures how content employees are with their roles. An engaged workforce, as indicated by a high ESAT, contributes to a positive organizational culture, driving your business forward.
Choosing the Right KPIs: Measuring What Matters Most
In business, there's no shortage of metrics you could keep an eye on. But let's be honest: not every KPI is a game-changer. As everything around us shifts - from customer tastes to new tech trends - the key is to focus on the metrics that truly drive your success.
Picking the right KPIs is less about data overload and more about understanding what really matters to your business. If you're wondering where to start, dive in to these straightforward guidelines:
Align with Business Objectives
The most critical KPIs are typically those that align directly with your current business objectives. These KPIs will depend on your strategic goals, whether it's expanding into a new market, improving customer satisfaction, or increasing operational efficiency. If a KPI doesn't align with what you're trying to achieve, it becomes a distraction.
Examples:
Market Share Percentage in New Market: When you're diving into a new market, this KPI lets you know how much of that market you've claimed compared to competitors. It’s like a progress bar for your expansion efforts.
Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT): Want to know if your customers are happy? CSAT does just that. It's a simple score that reflects how satisfied your customers are with your product or service. It’s a great way to ensure you’re meeting their needs.
Process Cycle Time or Cost Per Unit: To gauge the efficiency of your operations, keep an eye on how long processes take and how much they cost. It's like checking the health of your business’s engine – ensuring things run smoothly and cost-effectively.
Influence Business Performance
High-impact KPIs are those that directly influence revenue, profitability, or other major business outcomes. Identifying these KPIs requires a deep understanding of your business model and the key drivers of your success.
Examples:
Gross Profit Margin: This gives you a snapshot of your financial health by showing how much profit you make after covering the direct costs of producing your goods or services. It's a clear indicator of your production efficiency.
Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR): Especially valuable for subscription-based businesses, this KPI tells you how much predictable revenue you can expect every month. Think of it as a pulse check on your business's heart rate.
Customer Lifetime Value (LTV): This metric gives you a peek into the future, estimating how much a customer will be worth to your business over the entirety of their relationship. The higher the LTV, the more value each customer brings.
Focus on Quality, Not Quantity
Don't fall into the trap of measuring everything. Focus on the KPIs that provide real insights into your performance. When it comes to effective measurement, less can indeed be more.
Examples:
Overall Net Promoter Score (NPS): Instead of juggling numerous metrics to gauge customer satisfaction, the NPS simplifies it. NPS directly asks customers how likely they are to recommend you, giving a clear picture of customer loyalty.
Total Operational Efficiency: Instead of getting lost in the weeds of many smaller metrics, this KPI gives an overarching view of how efficiently your business operates.
Simplicity and Clarity
Avoid overly complicated KPIs. If a KPI is too complex, it can be difficult for team members to understand and can lead to misinterpretation. It's often better to focus on simple, clear KPIs that everyone can understand and act upon.
Examples:
Customer Retention Rate: A no-nonsense metric that lets you know how many of your customers stick around over a given period. It’s essentially a loyalty litmus test for your business.
Conversion Rate: If you want to know the effectiveness of your website in turning visitors into customers, this is your go-to metric.
Data-Driven Identification
Analyze historical data to identify which KPIs have been the best indicators of business performance in the past. Advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms can be particularly useful in this process, helping to identify patterns and relationships that might not be readily apparent.
Examples:
Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth: By comparing your performance to the previous year, you can spot growth trends and ensure you're moving in the right direction.
Average Monthly Active Users: A great pulse check on user engagement, helping you understand how many people are actively using your platform or product each month.
Promote Action
A useful KPI doesn't just inform; it prompts action. If a KPI isn't leading to concrete actions and improvements, it might be time to reconsider its value.
Examples:
Cart Abandonment Rate: If this rate is high, it's a nudge to refine your checkout process. Think of it as feedback without words.
Customer Complaints: High numbers here are a call to action. Addressing the cause of complaints can lead to immediate improvements in your product or service.
Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS): It's essential to know how your team feels. eNPS reveals whether your team would recommend your company as a great place to work.
Top Products Sold: Direct feedback from your sales team can spotlight which products are flying off the shelves and which might need a push.
Embrace Agility
In a dynamic business landscape, agility is key. Your KPIs should allow for quick pivots and adjustments, aligning with the ever-changing market demands.
Weekly Business Review (WBR): Hosting a WBR is essential for agile businesses. It's a dedicated time each week to review these agile KPIs, discuss challenges, and make real-time decisions. It ensures your team remains nimble, responsive, and united in its approach to ever-changing market dynamics.
Weekly Product Performance Metrics: With a frequent check-in, you can make quick adjustments to your product based on real-time feedback. Integrating these insights into your WBR ensures that the entire team is aligned and can act on the latest data.
Flash Surveys Post Major Releases: Just rolled out a significant update? Use these rapid-response surveys to immediately gauge user reactions. Discussing the outcomes in your WBR can help the team pivot swiftly if needed.
Tips for Getting Started with KPIs
When you're picking the right KPIs, it's a team sport. Chat with your team leads, managers, and those in the trenches every day. They've got on-the-ground insights that you won't find by crunching numbers alone.
You don't need to measure everything. Zero in on the KPIs that truly tell you how you're doing. Sometimes, focusing on fewer, more meaningful metrics is the way to go.
Keep in mind, businesses evolve, and so should your KPIs. Make it a habit to check in on them, tweak when needed, and ensure they're still in sync with where your business is headed.
Stick to these ideas, and your KPIs won't just be numbers on a dashboard. They'll be the compass guiding you in today's ever-changing business world.
Navigating Business with SMART KPIs
SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound, each a critical pillar in crafting KPIs that resonate with your business's essence. When applied to KPIs, it provides a framework to ensure the chosen indicators are effective and valuable to your business. Let's break down each component:
Specific: KPIs need to be clear and specific. Ambiguity can lead to confusion and may result in misinterpretation of the data. The KPI should pinpoint what it is you want to measure and why it's important.
Measurable: For a KPI to be effective, it must be measurable. That means it must be quantifiable or able to be translated into a relevant number or percentage. This allows for objective assessment of progress and performance.
Achievable: KPIs should be realistic and attainable. It's important to set targets that are challenging yet achievable with the resources and time available. If a target is impossible to reach, it may demotivate your team and undermine the purpose of having KPIs.
Relevant: The KPI should align with your business goals and objectives and your customer’s needs. It needs to be relevant to what your business is trying to achieve. Irrelevant KPIs can divert attention and resources away from what truly matters to your business.
Time-bound: KPIs should have a clear timeframe. This could be daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly depending on what you are measuring. Having a time-bound KPI allows for tracking progress over a specified period and helps in setting realistic targets.
In essence, SMART KPIs are a fusion of well-defined purpose, quantifiable targets, realistic ambitions, strategic alignment, and timely execution. They're not merely metrics but navigational tools that provide clear direction, facilitating the tracking of progress and performance over time.
By embracing the SMART framework, you create KPIs that are more than data points; they become strategic assets that reflect your business's unique goals and challenges. They guide decision-making, inspire action, and enable an agile response to an ever-changing business landscape. In this dynamic environment, let SMART KPIs be your compass, leading you to innovate, adapt, and thrive.
Navigating Industry Benchmarks: A Guided Approach to Aligning KPIs with Market Realities
Understanding industry standards and benchmarks isn't just a strategic advantage; it's a vital compass guiding your journey. Industry benchmarks act as both a measure and a mirror, reflecting where your business currently stands and illuminating the path to where it needs to go. They allow you to craft KPIs that are not only ambitious but firmly rooted in the reality of your business.
Expert Guidance in Uncharted Territory
In the complex landscape of industry benchmarks, the insights of Venture Capitalists and Wall Street investors—those who have already charted this intricate territory—become invaluable guides. Constantly scrutinizing customers, competitors, technology, and markets, their perspectives bridge the gap between static industry publications and the ever-changing real-world dynamics.
By aligning with these expert analysts, you not only keep pace with the latest trends but also sharpen your KPIs, making them more responsive to the current competitive environment.
Navigating the Complex Landscape of Industry Benchmarks: A Strategic Guide
In the rapidly evolving business environment, understanding and aligning with industry benchmarks is a vital compass to guide strategic decision-making. These benchmarks act as reference points, reflecting the pulse of the market and the position of your business within that vast landscape. One critical aspect of selecting effective KPIs is the consideration of industry benchmarks. This outlines a structured approach to integrate these benchmarks into your KPI selection process.
Setting Realistic Goals
With a clear understanding of industry benchmarks, you can establish realistic and achievable KPIs. Aligning your KPIs with industry standards ensures they are ambitious yet attainable. Remember, excessively high benchmarks may discourage your team, while exceedingly low ones may not push your organization towards sufficient growth.
By applying a systematic approach that intertwines industry insights with the unique essence of your business, you can learn how to navigate this complex terrain with precision and agility.
1. Research and Gather Data
Industry Publications: Utilize reports, trade publications, competitor analysis and government sources to gather valuable benchmark data. Tools like Business Evolution’s Competition and Market Masterclasses can be instrumental in this phase.
Analyst Insights: Engage with the sharp minds of Venture Capitalists and Wall Street investors who track your market. Their unique perspectives and real-time updates can provide invaluable guidance.
Subscription-Based Platforms: For well-funded startups or large enterprises, it is worth investing in specialized platforms, like Tableau or Domo, that may offer exclusive insights and a competitive edge.
2. Analyze Competitor Performance
Competitor Analysis: Look beyond the surface and examine how your competitors perform relative to benchmarks. Identify their strengths and weaknesses to uncover areas for differentiation or improvement. Business Evolution’s Competitor Masterclass teaches you how this is done.
Investor Perspectives: Leverage insights from savvy investors who track competitors, as they often provide deep analysis on competitive landscapes.
Performance Comparison: Using industry benchmarks to compare your performance against similar companies offers valuable insights. If competitors excel in specific areas where your company struggles, these areas represent potential opportunities for growth and improvement.
3. Contextualize Your Business
Fit and Targets: Understand how your business fits within the industry benchmarks and set realistic yet aspirational targets. This alignment ensures that your goals are both grounded and ambitious.
4. Identify Relevant Benchmarks
Initial Understanding: Start by gaining a comprehensive understanding of the standards within your industry. Industry benchmarks, representing either average or top-tier performance, provide a reference point for assessing your company's performance.
Benchmark Starting Point: Begin with benchmarks that resonate deeply with your industry and specific business objectives. This alignment ensures that your compass points in the direction that matters most to your organization.
5. Consider External Factors
Stay Attuned: Macroeconomic influences, regulatory changes, and technological advancements are ever-changing. Keeping a finger on these pulses ensures that your strategies adapt to the broader environment.
6. Monitor and Adapt
Continuous Alignment: Industry benchmarks are not static; they shift and evolve. Regularly revisit and update your understanding to reflect these shifts in your KPIs, ensuring that your strategies remain agile and relevant.
Consider Context and Unique Factors
While industry benchmarks offer a valuable reference point, they aren't a one-size-fits-all solution. Each organization is unique, with specific strengths, weaknesses, and strategic objectives. Always consider your business's unique context when setting KPIs, ensuring they align with your specific objectives and capabilities.
Remember: industry benchmarks serve as a powerful compass in the selection of KPIs, guiding businesses towards enhanced performance and success. However, they must be complemented with a deep understanding of your unique business context, capabilities, and objectives for an effective KPI selection strategy.
A Compass for Success
Weaving together insights from diverse sources provides a comprehensive and dynamic perspective on industry benchmarks. It's not just about numbers and comparisons; it's about crafting KPIs that resonate with your specific business context and the broader industry dynamics.
By identifying and focusing on the most important KPIs, businesses can ensure that they concentrate their efforts where they will have the most significant impact. However, remember that the importance of KPIs can change over time as the business and market environment evolve. Regular reviews and adjustments are necessary to ensure continued alignment with business objectives and market realities.
Turn KPIs into Action: Translate KPIs into specific actions that drive the organization forward.
This step is crucial as it ensures that the KPIs, which have been carefully selected and monitored, are not merely static measurements but become the driving force behind tangible actions within the organization. Translating the insights derived from Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) into specific, actionable strategies and tasks ensures that KPIs are actively used to guide decision-making and propel the organization towards its goals.
Why is it Important
KPIs by themselves are just numbers. The real value of KPIs comes from their ability to inform actions that align with business objectives. Without translating KPIs into concrete actions, the organization would miss the opportunity to utilize these insights for growth, improvement, and innovation.
Who Should be Involved

Monitor Implementation: Regularly monitor the progress of the action implementation. If necessary, use additional KPIs to track progress.
Evaluate Impact: Assess the impact of the actions on the organization's performance and on the KPIs themselves. This will provide insights into the effectiveness of the actions and inform future decisions.
Iterate as Needed: Based on the evaluation, make necessary adjustments to the actions or the way they are implemented, ensuring continuous alignment and improvement.
Document the Process: Maintain clear documentation of the actions taken, the rationale behind them, and the results achieved. This documentation will be valuable for future planning and decision-making.
Turning KPIs into action is a vital step in leveraging the power of KPIs for organizational success. It ensures that the insights derived from KPIs are not left as abstract numbers but are translated into tangible actions that drive the organization forward. By systematically analyzing, planning, implementing, and evaluating these actions, the organization can achieve alignment, agility, and continuous growth. Taking action transforms KPI data into strategic moves that resonate with the core objectives of the business, leading to sustained success.
Iterate and Refine:
The ongoing process of evaluating and modifying Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) ensures they continue to reflect the current objectives, strategies, and market conditions of the business. Iteration and refining ensures KPIs remain relevant, actionable, and effective in guiding your organization toward its goals. Here's a comprehensive walkthrough:

Analyzing business objectives is a vital step in the process of defining effective KPIs. By focusing on the core goals, values, and vision of the organization, this analysis ensures that the selected KPIs will be aligned with what truly matters to the business. It sets the stage for precision and relevance in subsequent exercises, laying a solid foundation for the organization to navigate its path to success. Without this analysis, there is a risk of selecting KPIs that are misaligned or superficial, leading to confusion and inefficiency. By investing time and effort in the analysis of business objectives, executives and strategic planners position the organization for clarity, alignment, and meaningful measurement.

By regularly tracking and making adjustments, you ensure that the KPIs remain aligned with business objectives and provide actionable insights to guide decision-making.
Why is it Important
Tracking and measuring KPIs is essential to understanding an organization's performance relative to its goals. Without consistent evolution, KPIs become static numbers rather than dynamic tools. Regular assessment enables timely adjustments, making sure that KPIs remain relevant and reflective of the organization's evolving needs.
Who Should be Involved
Data Analysts: Accountable for collecting and analyzing the data.
Managers and Department Heads: Ensure alignment with departmental goals and utilize KPI data for decision-making.

Data Analysis Software: Tools to analyze and visualize the data.
KPI Dashboard: A platform to visualize and monitor the KPIs in real-time.
Selected KPIs and Targets: Defined in step 2.
When Should it be Done
Measurement and monitoring are ongoing processes that begin immediately after the KPIs are selected and continue regularly throughout the life of the business or project.
How You Do it
Establish Monitoring Frequency: Decide how often the KPIs will be improved. The frequency may vary for different KPIs based on their nature and importance.
Analyze KPI Data: Regularly analyze the KPIs to assess their relevance in driving performance against your targets. Utilize statistical methods to identify trends, patterns, and deviations.
Emphasize Actionable Insights: Ensure that the KPIs are not just being tracked but are leading to concrete actions and improvements within the organization.
Maintain Data Integrity: Implement stringent data quality checks to ensure accuracy and consistency in measurement.
Adjust as Needed: Based on the analysis, make necessary adjustments to the KPIs, targets, or methodologies, to ensure the KPIs continue to align with business objectives and changing business landscape.
Communicate Results: Share the results with relevant stakeholders through regular reports, meetings, or digital platforms. Clear communication ensures that the performance of the KPIs are broadly understood.
Conclusion
Measuring and monitoring KPIs is an essential process that turns selected KPIs into actionable tools for organizational success. Through systematic data collection, regular analysis, and timely adjustments, KPIs become a living part of the organization, guiding decision-making and strategy. Beyond simply tracking numbers, this step creates a continuous feedback loop that allows the organization to adapt, grow, and innovate. Properly executed, it ensures that the organization stays aligned with its goals and remains agile in the face of a dynamic business environment.
Example KPIs
Example Financial KPIs
More than mere numbers, financial KPIs offer a strategic insight into your business's financial health. They enable you to assess performance, identify trends, and make decisions aligned with your financial goals, ensuring that your fiscal strategies resonate with your long-term vision. Here's a more detailed breakdown of pivotal financial KPIs:
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
Definition: Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) represents the sum of all the direct costs involved in creating a product or delivering a service that you've sold. Think of it as the money you've spent to directly produce what you sell. This encompasses raw materials, labor directly linked to the production, and any other direct expenses tied to the manufacturing process.
Benefit: Grasping your COGS is crucial, not just for accountants, but for you, the business leader. Why? Because understanding COGS allows you to pinpoint how efficiently you're producing your goods or services. If your COGS is rising, it might be time to assess your production process or negotiate with suppliers. On the other hand, a decreasing COGS might indicate that you're onto something right - whether it's an efficient production method, better inventory management, or smart purchasing decisions. Ultimately, a keen eye on COGS helps in maximizing profits and ensuring your pricing strategies are on point.
Equation: COGS = (Beginning Inventory + Purchases) - Ending Inventory
Beginning Inventory: This is the value of the stock you have on hand at the start of a fiscal period. It's essentially what you're left with from the previous period.
Purchases: This is the total amount spent on inventory that you've bought during the period. It doesn't matter whether you've sold it yet or not; if you've bought it, it counts.
Ending Inventory: This is the value of the stock remaining unsold at the close of a fiscal period.
Example: Let's use a quick example. Imagine you started off the year with an inventory valued at $10,000. Over the year, you made purchases amounting to $50,000. By year-end, you had $15,000 worth of inventory unsold. Using the above formula, your COGS would be:
COGS = ($10,000 + $50,000) - $15,000
COGS = $45,000
Return on Investment (ROI)
Definition: Return on Investment (ROI) is a financial metric that's widely used to measure the likelihood of gaining a return from an investment. It shows how effectively and efficiently investment dollars are used to generate profits. In simpler terms, ROI lets you see if the money you pour into a project, product, or initiative is flowing back to you, and at what rate.
Benefit: Understanding ROI is more than just knowing a formula; it's about grasping the value it brings to your decision-making. For you, as an entrepreneur or executive, ROI isn't merely a percentage; it's a compass. A positive ROI indicates that your efforts are moving in the right direction – that your investments, whether they're in marketing campaigns, new software, or hiring decisions, are paying off. Conversely, a negative ROI can serve as a warning, prompting a reassessment or change in strategy. By consistently tracking ROI, you'll be better equipped to make informed decisions, allocate resources effectively, and prioritize projects that are most beneficial to your business's growth.
Equation: ROI = (Profit - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment
Example: If you invested $10,000 into a venture and, after covering all associated costs, you made a profit of $2,000, the calculation would be:
ROI = ($2,000 - $10,000) / $10,000
ROI = 20%
Revenue Concentration:
Definition: This measures how your revenue is spread across different client segments or products.
Benefit: By identifying which segments or products contribute most to your revenue, you can strategically allocate resources and hone your business focus.
Calculation: (Revenue from a specific source / Total Revenue) x 100
Net Profit Margin:
Definition: The proportion of profit you retain after deducting all business expenses.
Benefit: It's a clear indicator of your overall profitability, ensuring you're pricing products/services appropriately and managing expenses.
Calculation: (Net Income / Total Revenue) x 100
Debt-to-Equity Ratio:
Definition: This ratio contrasts your company's total liabilities against shareholder equity.
Benefit: A crucial metric for assessing financial leverage and understanding how you're funding your operations.
Calculation: Total Liabilities / Shareholders’ Equity
Accounts Receivable Turnover:
Definition: This KPI reveals the efficiency in collecting payments owed to your business.
Benefit: Ensuring prompt payments is crucial for maintaining a healthy cash flow.
Calculation: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable
Working Capital:
Definition: This signifies the funds you have on hand for day-to-day operations.
Benefit: A positive working capital indicates you can cover short-term debts, essential for sustaining business operations.
Calculation: Current assets minus current liabilities
Example Sales KPIs
Sales Revenue
Definition: The total income generated from the sale of goods or services before any costs or expenses are deducted.
Benefit: Gives you an overview of your business's financial health and indicates the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts.
Equation: Sales Revenue = Number of Units Sold x Price Per Unit
Sales Growth Rate:
Definition: Measures the percentage increase or decrease in sales over a specific period, offering a clear view of your business' momentum.
Benefit: A positive rate indicates growth, while a negative rate signals a decline, helping you adjust your strategies accordingly.
Equation: Sales Growth Rate (%) = ((Current Sales - Previous Sales) / Previous Sales) x 100
Sales by Region:
Definition: Breaks down your sales data geographically, revealing which regions are most lucrative.
Benefit: Prioritize regions that consistently perform well and consider strategies to improve underperforming areas.
Equation: Aggregate sales data per region using your data analytics tool.
Sales by Channel:
Definition: Delineates which sales channels, like online, in-store, or through partners, generate the most revenue.
Benefit: Allocate resources to the best-performing channels and re-evaluate or enhance underperforming ones.
Equation: Aggregate sales data by channel using analytics tools.
Sales by Market Segment:
Definition: Differentiates sales based on target market categories such as age, industry, or socioeconomic status.
Benefit: Tailor marketing strategies to resonate with high-performing segments and understand potential growth areas.
Equation: Segment sales data based on predefined market categories.
Example Product & Marketing KPIs
Marketing, the voice of your business, requires careful measurement. By tracking specific marketing KPIs, you can evaluate campaign success, refine messaging, and ensure that your marketing efforts truly connect with your target audience, building brand equity and loyalty.
Net Promoter Score (NPS)
Definition: NPS is like the pulse of your customer's sentiment towards your product or service. It measures how willing they are to recommend your offering to others.
Benefit: Imagine having a magic mirror that tells you what customers really think about your business. That's your NPS. When you understand your NPS, you're unlocking insights into customer loyalty, satisfaction, and the overall health of your customer relationships. A high score indicates your customers love what you're doing. A lower score gives you a golden opportunity to refine and improve.
Equation: NPS = Percentage of Promoters - Percentage of Detractors. To get your NPS:
Survey your customers: ""How likely are you to recommend our product to a friend or colleague?"" (0-10 scale)
Categorize the responses:
0-6 are Detractors
7-8 are Passives
9-10 are Promoters
According to Bain & Company, scores:
0 - 20 = Good
21 - 50 = Favorable
51 - 80 = Excellent
81+ = World Class
Product Engagement
Definition: Product Engagement is a measure of how actively users are interacting with your product. Think of it as the ‘stickiness’ factor.
Benefit: When you track Product Engagement, you're essentially measuring the heartbeat of your user activity. High engagement indicates a product that's resonating with return users. By keeping an eye on this, you can identify features that are a hit (or miss) and fine-tune your offerings to ensure your users stay hooked.
Active users: The number of users who have logged into your product in a given period of time.
Daily active users (DAUs): The number of users who have logged into your product on a given day.
Weekly active users (WAUs): The number of users who have logged into your product in a given week.

Stickiness: The percentage of users who return to your product after their first session.
Conversion rate: The percentage of users who take a desired action, such as making a purchase or signing up for a free trial.
Retention Rate
Definition: Retention Rate is your compass to customer loyalty. It pinpoints the percentage of your customers who've decided to stick around and continue using your product over a specific period.
Benefit: In the bustling world of business, attracting a new customer is an achievement. Furthermore, high retention rates are often a sign of customer satisfaction. It means your product or service is delivering value consistently. By focusing on improving retention, you're not just keeping customers; you're fostering brand advocates.
Equation: Retention rate = ((Number of customers at end of period - Number of new customers during period) / (Number of customers at start of period)) x 100
Churn (Customer Attrition Rate)
Definition: The percentage of customers who stop doing business with a company during a specific time frame.
Benefit: Helps in identifying potential issues with products or services and informs customer retention strategies.
Equation: Churn Rate (%) = (Number of Customers Lost / Total Customers at Start of Period) x 100
Customer Satisfaction
Definition: A measure, often obtained through surveys, indicating how satisfied customers are with your products or services.
Benefit: Direct feedback helps improve offerings and enhances customer retention. High scores indicate strong product-market fit and service quality.

1: Gathering Data on Your Company's Weekly KPIs
For a successful Weekly Business Review (WBR), accurate and relevant data is the foundation. Gathering this data ensures that the discussions and decisions in subsequent steps are grounded in reality and not based on assumptions. Hence, the process should be methodical and comprehensive.
Identify the KPIs: Start by listing down the key performance indicators (KPIs) that are crucial for your business. These KPIs should align with your company's goals and objectives. For instance, if revenue growth is a primary focus, then weekly sales data might be a key metric.
Use Reliable Data Sources: Ensure the data comes from credible and reliable sources. This could be your company's internal databases, CRM system, sales platforms, or any other tool where performance data is recorded.
Automate Data Retrieval: If possible, utilize automation tools or software that can extract the required data without manual intervention. Automation ensures efficiency and consistency in data collection.
Check Data Integrity: Once the data is gathered, quickly review it to check for any discrepancies or anomalies. This step is crucial to ensure your WBR is based on accurate information.
Compile the Data: Bring together the collected data in one centralized location, be it a spreadsheet, a dashboard, or any other data visualization tool. Consolidation aids in easy access and analysis during the WBR.
By meticulously gathering your company's weekly KPI data, you ensure that your WBR discussions are grounded in actual performance metrics. This accuracy is pivotal for making informed decisions that can propel your business forward. Furthermore, having a clear picture of your performance metrics allows your team to identify areas of excellence.
2: Organizing and Structuring Your Weekly KPI Data
Step 2 ensures that the data serves its purpose: to inform, enlighten, and guide strategic decision-making.
The crux of this step is to make the data both accessible and interpretable. The raw data, while crucial, might be overwhelming or confusing to many. By organizing it and presenting it in a digestible manner, you facilitate effective analysis, discussion, and decision-making in the subsequent steps of the WBR. The document will be used to provide specific guidance on the best practices and tools for this task.
Data Organization: Begin by segmenting your data based on categories or departments. This ensures that similar metrics are grouped together, simplifying the analysis process. For instance, financial metrics can be grouped separately from customer feedback metrics.
Choose Appropriate Visualization Tools: The document mentions the importance of using tools that can help visualize data effectively. Consider tools such as Excel, for basic visualizations, or more advanced platforms like Tableau or Microsoft Power BI for intricate data sets. The right tool can transform numbers into meaningful insights.
Highlight Key Trends: Within your presentation, ensure that significant trends, whether positive or negative, are emphasized. This ensures that critical points are not lost in the sea of data.
Use Descriptive Labels: To minimize ambiguity and make it easier for stakeholders to understand the data, ensure that every chart, graph, or table has clear and descriptive labels.
Provide Context: Where relevant, provide context to the data. This could be in the form of annotations, historical comparisons, or industry benchmarks. Context can help stakeholders understand the significance of the data points.
Interactive Dashboards: If using advanced tools, consider creating interactive dashboards that allow stakeholders to delve deeper into specific areas of interest, fostering a more engaged and proactive approach to data analysis.
Practice Your Presentation: Before the WBR, familiarize yourself with the data presentation. Ensure that you can guide stakeholders through it smoothly, addressing questions and highlighting key points.
By organizing and presenting your data effectively, you set the stage for a productive WBR. Clear, comprehensible data presentations can lead to sharper insights, more informed discussions, and actionable strategies. For your business, this leads to decisions grounded in reality and ensures your strategies are both relevant and impactful. For your team, a clear understanding of the data fosters alignment by ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding the company's performance and direction.
3: Convening the relevant stakeholders and team members
Step 3 is geared towards not just having a meeting, but ensuring that the meeting is a powerful tool for business strategy and growth.
The effectiveness of a WBR hinges largely on the people present. Their insights, expertise, and feedback can transform raw data into actionable strategies. Thus, it's crucial to ensure the right people are in the room (or virtual meeting). The document will guide us on how to identify these individuals and ensure their participation.
Identify the Key Participants: Before sending out invites, make a list of essential personnel. These are individuals directly linked to the KPIs being discussed. Typically, this would include department heads, team leaders, and specialists. The uploaded document may provide specifics on roles crucial for your organization's WBRs.
Notify in Advance: Considering the packed schedules of executives and key team members, it's vital to notify them well in advance. This ensures they can block off time and come prepared.
Set a Clear Agenda: Along with the invite, send out a clear agenda. Outline the key points of discussion, any preparatory work required, and the expected outcomes of the WBR. This helps attendees prepare and ensures the meeting is productive.
Choose the Right Environment: Whether it's a physical meeting room or a virtual platform, ensure the environment is conducive to focused discussions. This means a quiet room, the necessary tech setup for presentations, and a comfortable seating arrangement.
Encourage Active Participation: It's not enough for stakeholders to be present; they need to be active contributors. At the start of the WBR, set the expectation that everyone's input is valuable and that open, constructive discussions are encouraged.
Set Ground Rules: Especially for larger WBRs, set some ground rules. This could include no interruptions when someone is speaking, sticking to the set agenda, and ensuring discussions remain constructive.
Convening the right stakeholders ensures that your WBR benefits from diverse insights and expertise. This collaborative approach means decisions are holistic, taking into account various facets of the business. For your product, this means strategies that are well-rounded and considerate of all relevant factors. For your team, it fosters a sense of collective ownership and alignment. And for your business, it ensures that decisions are made with a comprehensive understanding, driving more effective strategies and better outcomes.
4: Engaging in a Constructive Discussion on Weekly KPIs
Step 4 is designed to ensure that discussions are not just routine check-ins, but powerful strategy sessions that drive business growth.
The discussion phase is where raw data transforms into actionable insights. It's where the collective wisdom of the convened team dissects the presented data, identifies trends, celebrates successes, and flags concerns. The aim is to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that there's a clear understanding of the business's current standing.
Begin with Achievements: Start the conversation on a positive note by first acknowledging what went well. Highlight any KPIs that exceeded expectations or notable achievements from specific departments or teams.
Transition to Trends: Using the organized data, walk the team through noticeable trends. This could be patterns emerging over multiple weeks or sudden spikes and drops in specific metrics. The goal is to understand the 'why' behind these trends.
Address Areas of Concern: With achievements and trends covered, it's time to delve into metrics that didn't meet expectations. Address any concerns or anomalies in the data, seeking insights from relevant stakeholders to understand the root causes.
Promote Open Dialogue: Encourage all participants to share their perspectives. The more comprehensive the discussion, the richer the insights. Remember, the goal is collective understanding and problem-solving, not finger-pointing.
Document Key Takeaways: As the discussion progresses, ensure someone is tasked with documenting key insights, action items, and concerns. This will be crucial for the subsequent steps of formulating action plans and assigning responsibilities.
Summarize and Confirm Understanding: Before concluding the discussion, provide a brief summary of the main takeaways. This ensures that everyone leaves with a clear understanding and there are no ambiguities.
Engaging in a thorough discussion of your company's weekly KPIs ensures that every stakeholder is aligned and informed. It provides clarity on where the company stands, what's working, and what needs attention. For your product, this means strategies that are grounded in real-world performance data. For your team, it fosters alignment, ensuring everyone is working towards common goals. And for your business, these discussions drive informed and impactful decision-making, propelling your business towards its objectives.
5: Crafting Effective Action Plans from WBR Insights
Step 5 is where the rubber meets the road. It's the transition from understanding to action, and its effectiveness will determine the impact of the entire WBR process.
Post-discussion, the next critical phase is to turn insights into actionable plans. It's the bridge between understanding and execution. The strategies formulated here will guide the company's actions in the ensuing week(s) and will be pivotal in addressing concerns and leveraging strengths.
Prioritize Insights: Not all insights will carry the same weight or urgency. Start by categorizing the insights derived from the discussion in terms of their impact and immediacy. This will help focus resources on the most pressing or impactful items first.
Brainstorm Solutions: For each prioritized insight, brainstorm potential strategies or actions. This should be a collaborative effort, drawing on the expertise of the relevant stakeholders. Remember, diversity of thought often leads to the most innovative solutions.
Evaluate Feasibility: Before finalizing any action plan, assess its feasibility in terms of resources, time, and potential risks. This ensures that the strategies are not just good on paper but are practical and executable.
Set Clear Outcomes: For each action plan, define what success looks like. Whether it's achieving a specific metric, resolving a concern, or leveraging an opportunity, having a clear target ensures measurability and accountability.
Seek Feedback: Before finalizing the strategies, seek feedback from the team. This not only refines the plan but also ensures buy-in, increasing the likelihood of successful execution.
Document Everything: Ensure that every strategy or action plan is documented, including its rationale, expected outcome, and resources required. This serves as a reference point and ensures clarity in execution.
Crafting effective action plans ensures that insights from the WBR translate into tangible business outcomes. For your product, this means strategies that directly address its real-world performance, enhancing its strengths and mitigating its weaknesses. For your team, clear action plans provide direction, ensuring everyone knows their role in driving the business forward. And for your business, these plans, rooted in data and collaborative insights, set the stage for informed actions that drive growth and address challenges.
6: Assigning Responsibilities for Effective Implementation
Step 6 is about converting strategy into action. It's about ensuring that each action item has a steward, ensuring a systematic and organized approach to implementation.
Once strategies are in place, assigning clear responsibilities is paramount. This ensures that each action item has an owner, someone accountable for its execution. Without clear ownership, even the best-laid plans can fall by the wayside. The document will guide us on how to efficiently assign these responsibilities, ensuring successful implementation.
Match Expertise with Tasks: Begin by aligning the action items with the expertise of team members. Assign tasks based on individuals' strengths, experience, and skill sets. This ensures that each task is handled by someone best equipped to execute it.
Clear Communication: Once responsibilities are decided, communicate them clearly to each individual or team. Ensure they understand not just the 'what' but also the 'why' behind their assigned tasks.
Provide Necessary Resources: Ensure that individuals or teams have the necessary resources – be it tools, budget, or manpower – to execute their tasks. This might involve coordinating with other departments or securing additional resources.
Set Deadlines: Every task should have a clear deadline. This not only provides a timeframe for execution but also aids in tracking progress and ensures timely completion.
Open Channels for Queries: Encourage team members to raise questions or seek clarifications on their responsibilities. This proactive approach ensures smoother execution and minimizes potential roadblocks.
Document Assignments: Maintain a centralized document or platform where all responsibilities are listed, along with their respective owners and deadlines. This serves as a reference point and can be useful for tracking progress.
Assigning clear responsibilities ensures that each formulated strategy has a clear path to execution. For your product, this means that each facet of its performance is actively being addressed. For your team, clear responsibilities provide direction and a sense of ownership, boosting morale and accountability. For your business, this organized approach ensures that strategies are not just formulated but are actively implemented, driving tangible results.
7: Scheduling and Preparing for the Subsequent WBR
Step 7 is about cementing the WBR as a recurring strategic tool, ensuring the continuous evolution and refinement of business strategies.
The WBR is not a one-off event; it's a recurring strategic tool. By scheduling the next review, you're ensuring continuity in the process. This upcoming meeting serves as both a deadline and a checkpoint, ensuring strategies are implemented and their outcomes are evaluated. The document will guide us on how to effectively schedule and set the stage for the next WBR.
Pick a Consistent Time: Consistency aids in planning. Try to schedule WBRs at the same time, be it every week, fortnight, or month. This helps stakeholders keep that slot free and sets a rhythm to the review process.
Consider Stakeholders' Availability: Before finalizing a date and time, check the availability of key stakeholders. Their participation is crucial, so ensure the timing is convenient for them.
Set Clear Objectives: Every WBR might have a slightly different focus based on current business needs. When scheduling the next WBR, set clear objectives. What are the key areas you wish to cover? Are there specific challenges or opportunities you want to address?
Send a Reminder: As the date approaches, send out a reminder to all participants with the agenda, objectives, and any preparatory material they might need.
Allocate Time for Strategy Review: Ensure a portion of the next WBR is dedicated to reviewing the outcomes of the strategies implemented post the current WBR. This ensures accountability and allows the team to learn from both successes and shortcomings.
Encourage Feedback: After each WBR, seek feedback on the process. Was there adequate data? Was the discussion productive? Were the action items clear? This feedback can be used to refine and improve subsequent WBRs.
Scheduling the next WBR ensures there's a structured mechanism to review and recalibrate strategies. For your product, this means continuous attention to its performance and adaptability to changing circumstances. For your team, the regularity of WBRs provides clarity and direction, ensuring everyone is aligned and working towards shared objectives. For your business, the consistent review of strategies ensures agility, allowing your business to adapt, evolve, and grow in a dynamic market.",3945

Product Discovery
Introduction
This course will teach you how to execute a product discovery process that will increase your product’s odds of success. Before you start, please note the following:
This course was designed primarily with technology products in mind, but the information here can also be applied to other types of products.
This course presents a sequence of steps that a product manager would typically follow. However, every product and team is different so we encourage you to adapt this process as needed. Feel free to choose your own sequence or even skip certain steps if you feel they don’t apply to you.
What is Product Discovery?
Product discovery is a process that increases the odds of product success. It attempts to answer the question: what should we build and for whom? Product discovery starts with the basic assumption that no matter how well you think you know your customer, you still face a number of risks when starting out. In product discovery, we define these risks as follows:
Value risk – Will customers choose to pay for your product (or become regular users if the product is free)?
Usability risk – Is your product designed in such a way that customers will be able to use it efficiently and enjoyably?
Feasibility risk – Will your team be able to build and maintain the product given your available time and resources?
Business viability risk – Does your product support the company’s business goals?
With product discovery you can reduce these risks before you spend money developing or launching your product. Ignoring or shortcutting the discovery process can result in excessively high risks in or more of these areas. This, in turn, increases the likelihood that your product will fail or possibly never even launch.
Problem vs. Solution Space
At the beginning of product discovery, you will be alternating frequently between two modes of thought: what is the problem I am trying to solve and what is the solution to that problem? We call these the problem and solution spaces. As you gain clarity around the problem, you will spend more time in the solution space. That said, it is crucial to make sure you correctly identify the problem or your solution will be worthless.
Hypotheses Validation
One way to think of product discovery is like a laboratory in which you will be running a series of experiments. As with scientific experiments, you will use product discovery experiments to test hypotheses about the problem and solution you are working on. In designing these experiments, you must make sure that you are able to capture the necessary data to determine if your hypothesis is true or false. We call this process hypothesis validation. In general, as you move through product discovery, you will want to test your riskiest hypotheses at each stage. This way, you minimize the odds of a high risk issue coming back to bite you later in the process.
Discovery Techniques
Over the years a number of effective discovery techniques have been invented and more are still being created. In this course we review some of the most popular and effective techniques. Choosing the right technique depends on the type of product you are building, your market, available resources, and other factors. But no matter which technique you use, product discovery is all about “getting out of the building” and testing your ideas with real customers.
Points to Consider
Discovery is a journey – As the term “discovery” implies, the product we are seeking already exists and our job is to conceptualize and define it. But discovery is rarely a straight path. Be prepared for detours, meandering and even going in circles. This can feel unsettling, but rest assured, if you follow these steps, you will always be getting closer to the final destination.
Discovery is a continuous process – Launching your product doesn’t mean the end of the discovery process. In fact, this is really just a new beginning. As you receive customer feedback you will uncover even more problems and opportunities that your product can address. Likewise, you will discover adjacent problems that your product can expand into; for example: Amazon started selling books, then CDs, then DVDs and ultimately nearly everything. Discovery will remain an essential tool for defining these new solutions.
Discovery is multi-disciplinary – Great products result from tight collaboration between engineering, design, marketing and product management. Make sure these team members are an integral part of your discovery process.

STEP ONE: Customer Discovery Interviews
Source: Launch Lab
Expand
The best way to begin your product discovery journey is to talk to prospective customers. In product discovery we use a very specific technique called customer discovery interviews to get the most out of these encounters. What makes this approach unique is that it avoids directly asking the customer what they think of our solution. Instead we ask open ended questions to uncover opportunities and understand behaviors, beliefs, and motivations. To learn more about asking open ended questions please use the following resources:
HotJar: https://www.hotjar.com/blog/open-ended-questions/
Hubspot: https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/the-art-of-asking-open-ended-questions
Even if you already think you know your customer, these types of interviews can be eye opening. You may even discover you are targeting the wrong customer. Interviews also bring your customers to life in a way that research reports can never match.
How to Interview
Even though customer discovery interviews follow an open ended approach, this doesn’t mean they aren’t structured. You will create a script beforehand to make sure you don’t forget any important questions. For a B2B product, these might include:
Tell me about your role at the company?
What’s a typical day like?
What is the hardest problem you currently face?
What solutions have you tried to solve that problem?
What do you like and dislike about those solutions?
We have included links below to sample questions and instructions on how to create your own questions.
Whom to Interview
As discussed, an underlying philosophy of customer discovery interviews is to avoid making assumptions about your target customer. Therefore, you should start by forming a hypothesis about the profile of your target customer. Then, conduct a few interviews with that customer profile to test your hypothesis. If it turns out you were wrong, form a new hypothesis and start the process over. Eventually, you will discover the correct profile or realize that you have reached a dead end, at which point, it may be time to start working on a new idea. Another challenge you may face is recruiting interview subjects. This can be time consuming and requires creative thinking. Here are some of the most common recruiting approaches:
Networking – Ask friends and colleagues for introductions. Use Linkedin and other social media sites to recruit candidates.
Introductions from interviewee – Each person you interview provides an opportunity for further introductions. For example, if you are interviewing B2B subjects, your script should include questions like “Is there anyone else in your department you think I should speak to about this problem.”
Meetups – Attend a meet-up focused on your target industry or start one yourself.
Points to Consider
Practice makes perfect – The customer discovery interview approach is unnatural for most people. We are used to asking for feedback, not asking open ended questions, and listening carefully for nuggets of insight. Therefore, your first few interviews may not be very productive. Instead of wasting the opportunity, do some practice interviews with friends or colleagues first. You can also hire an experienced researcher to conduct the interviews for you.
The goal is learning, not selling – Whatever you do, resist the temptation to ask for specific feedback about your idea. This is likely to bias your data because most interviewees will try to please you. If you feel the need to ask for direct feedback, wait until the end of the interview until after you have received sufficient unbiased information from the interviewee.
Invite your team – As discussed, discovery is a collaborative process. If at all possible bring along your designer and engineer. This will enable them to more effectively extract insights from the interviewee’s responses by observing body language and facial expressions. It will also give everyone on the team a shared reference point during later discussions about product features. That said, make sure your interviewee is comfortable with multiple observers. You also minimize discomfort by conducting the interview so that you are the only one speaking with your teammates remaining silent observers.

STEP TWO: Customer Journey Map
Source: Launch Lab
Expand
A customer journey map is a diagram that shows how customers interact with a product as they move through different stages of use. Creating a journey map has several benefits:
Uncovers problems and opportunities – Journey maps are a great way to identify pain points that your product can potentially address. Conversely, they help you identify parts of the journey where customers are satisfied with their existing solution and may not be interested in yours.
Empathy – Journey maps help bring your customer’s experience to life and create shared empathy among your team.
Inspires system-level thinking – The process of creating a journey map forces you to break down how the customer experiences your sales process, marketing and product into discrete touchpoints that work in unison to influence customer behavior.
Journey Map Design
The type of data displayed on journey maps vary widely but the basic format is the same: a horizontal diagram divided into columns representing stages or touchpoints. Each touchpoint represents an interaction with a company or its product. The diagram’s rows are used to communicate various aspects of the customer’s experience at each stage. The possibilities here are nearly endless, but you will probably want your map to answer the following questions at each stage:
What goal is the customer trying to achieve?
Are they satisfied or dissatisfied?
What problems are they encountering?
Source: Launch Lab
Expand
Creating your Map
Prior to launching your product you will be using the journey map to diagram your customer’s interactions with existing solutions. After you launch, you can use journey maps to analyze customer interactions with your own product. Here’s how to create your first journey map:
Choose a customer profile – What type of customer will your map focus on? For maximum accuracy, you should base your map on the experiences of your interview subjects. You can even combine multiple subjects into a single profile. You can also bring these profiles to life with a technique called personas. If you haven’t yet created personas, we provide more information about them here.
Define a scenario – What overall goal is the customer is trying to achieve? For example, if they are buying a car, the map should be confined to activities related to that scenario.
Define your touchpoints – What stages does the customer go through as they complete the scenario?
Decide what to analyze – For each stage in the journey, you will be analyzing some aspect of the customer’s experience. Create horizontal rows for each type of experience you wish to analyze.
Map the customer journey – Fill out the horizontal rows on your map with the data you are analyzing at each stage. If you have insufficient knowledge to complete this step, you can conduct additional interviews or surveys.
Points to Consider
Validate your assumptions - When you first create your map it's acceptable to leave gaps or make assumptions when you don’t have enough data. The process of creating the map is valuable in and of itself because it forces you to put yourself in the customer's shoes. However, it is risky to continue the product discovery process for too long without closing these gaps because over time you and your team are likely to accept these assumptions as facts. Therefore it's important to have a plan in place to validate your map by asking actual customers about their journey.
Start with the pre-purchase experience – Even though you are focused on product discovery, it's important to map the parts of the journey that take place before the customer encounters your product, such as your sales and marketing efforts. These can provide valuable insights about how to design a better product. By the same token, don’t forget about the post-purchase experience. How do customers get support if they have problems, or refunds if so desired?

STEP THREE: Surveys
Source: Launch Lab
Expand
While interviews allow you to go deep with a particular customer, they are time consuming. By contrast, surveys allow you to quickly gather data from large numbers of potential customers. Unlike interviews, the data will not be as rich. Surveys can, however, be excellent tools for enriching the customer profiles from your interviews and even testing demand.
Survey Goals
The first step is to decide on your goals for the survey. You have two basic choices:
Gathering additional data about your target customer – You can use surveys to answer questions that weren’t adequately answered during your interviews or that you didn’t have time to ask. Since surveys can be anonymous, you can also ask questions that would have been awkward to ask during an interview, such as the customer's income. Surveys can also provide statistical validation for the answers you received during interviews, This is especially useful if you received conflicting answers from multiple interview subjects.
Testing demand – Unlike discovery interviews, surveys can be a useful tool for determining whether customers are actually interested in your product. You can do this by describing the product in words or images and asking a series of questions to gauge interest (e.g. “How much would you pay for this product,” or “Would you recommend this product to a friend?”). However, you should not rely solely on such data to validate your hypotheses. This is because such a survey is only a weak simulation of real life. No matter how vivid your description, it's unlikely to match the customers real-world experience once they are faced with a buying decision.
Types of Questions
Next, you will need to decide on the types of questions to ask. The first decision you will have to make is whether your questions will be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative questions restrict the respondent to a finite set of choices, while qualitative questions enable write-in responses. You can combine both approaches, but for a large scale survey you will want to emphasize the quantitative. This is because it is time consuming and often impossible to summarize qualitative data in a way that is statistically useful. However, if you are surveying a small number of customers, a qualitative survey can be very effective.
Recruiting
Recruiting survey respondents can be a challenge, especially for large scale surveys. If you are planning a quantitative survey, you will want the results to be statistically valid. This may mean hundreds of responses. You will also need to assume that not everyone you invite to the survey will actually complete it, and some of those who do complete the survey may not actually be your target customer. So how do you recruit enough people to ensure a sufficient number of valid responses? That depends on your budget. The best free option is likely to be social media. Paid options include running ads search or social media sites, purchasing a mailing list or using a research panel such as Survey Monkey Audience.
Points to Consider
Make sure you are surveying the right customer – No matter how well-targeted your recruiting effort, some of the people who take your survey will fall outside of your target profile. Therefore you should start your survey with a series of qualifying questions to make sure the person is a potential customer.
Keep it short – The longer your survey, the lower your completion rate will be. Therefore it's important to trim your list of questions to the absolute essentials.
Ask for permission to follow up – Your survey doesn’t have to be the end of the conversation with a respondent. You can use the survey to capture their email and ask if they would be willing to answer follow up questions

STEP FOUR: Prototyping
Source: Launch Lab
Expand
By now you should have a clear idea of the customer problem you want to solve. At this stage, prototyping is an excellent next step because it will accelerate your ability to find the right solution. A prototype is a crude version of your product (or part of your product) that can be used to obtain feedback from either your target customer or an internal stakeholder. Prototypes can be created and tested very quickly and cheaply, so the typical prototyping process is iterative. You will create prototypes, obtain feedback, refine them and repeat the cycle until you have confidence in the solution.
Kinds of Prototypes
Prototypes take many different forms, each of which can be used to test different types of risk. However, they are best for assessing either value risk and usability risk. It is possible to assess feasibility risk with a prototype but this is less common and requires writing code. Another key distinction is a prototype's level of fidelity. This is the degree of polish or realism that the prototype exhibits. Prototypes can either be low or high fidelity. These differ as follows:
Low fidelity – These prototypes are primitive and easier to create. They are used earlier in the design process to rapidly test and iterate ideas until the team has enough confidence to consider building a high fidelity prototype. Low fidelity prototypes are better suited for internal feedback and ideation since they may be hard for customers to understand without extensive explanation. Examples include sketches, paper prototypes, wireframes and mockups.
High fidelity – These take longer to create but enable more accurate feedback and are better suited for testing with actual customers. High fidelity prototypes are typically created later in the process, and due to their detailed nature, they can be very effective at assessing usability risk. Examples include interactive prototypes, video prototypes and live data prototypes.
Prototype Testing
You can test your prototypes either internally with your team or externally with customers. Internal testing is faster but the results are less reliable. Therefore internal testing is ideal in the early stages of the design process when you are seeking an overall direction. It is also an excellent way to obtain quick feedback on a design before testing it externally. As your design evolves and you gain more confidence in it, you should test externally.
There are no hard and fast rules about how to test prototypes. For internal testing, the process can be as informal as walking into a teammate’s office and showing them a sketch and asking for their thoughts. With external customers, you will want to provide more structure. In either case, you should observe the following best practices:
Set goals – Know in advance what you are trying to learn from the test. For example, if you are assessing value risk, structure your questions around this topic by asking questions like “Whom do you think would be interested in this product?” or “How often do you think you would use this product?.” If your goals include testing specific hypotheses, make a list of these and tailor your questions accordingly.
Remain neutral – As with customer discovery interviews, your goal is to learn, not to sell. Avoid biasing your subject by keeping your feelings to yourself whether the feedback is positive or negative. If the subject is confused about the design, it's acceptable to provide an explanation, but by no means should you defend it.
Collaborate with your subject – Make it clear to your subject that you are there to learn and are seeking their help to solve any problems they identify. Invite contributions that build on your prototype. If you receive negative feedback ask for their suggestions about how to improve the product.
Points to Consider
Focus on high risk areas first – Throughout the product discovery process you should test your riskiest hypothesis at each stage. This is especially important for prototypes because they can take considerable time to create. This way you minimize the chances of high risk issues going unnoticed and cropping up later in the design process.
Consider testing multiple versions simultaneously – If you have the time and resources, testing multiple versions of the same prototype can produce more actionable and accurate results. This is because it frees your subjects from feeling like they have to say something positive about the first version they are presented. It also gives them the opportunity to contrast the two prototypes and provide more detailed feedback.
Include your team – Even more so than other stages of product discovery, prototyping should be collaborative. Make sure to include your design and engineering colleagues during prototype creation. Try to include them during testing, or at least debrief with them after every round of testing.

Minimum Viable Product
Source: Launch Lab
Expand
By now, your answers to the questions “what should we build and for whom?” should be coming into focus. But remember, until you launch an actual product with real customers, these are just assumptions and you are likely still facing significant risks. The good news is that you can measurably reduce these risks with a minimum viable product or MVP.
What is an MVP?
An MVP is simply a prototype with a distinct difference: as the name implies, it is “viable.” We define viability as follows:
The MVP can be experienced by your target customer without the kind of hand-holding or explanation that is required for a prototype.
The MVP is designed in such a way that it is capable of reliably testing at least one hypothesis.
And of course, MVPs are minimal. How minimal? As minimal as you can make them and still test at least one hypothesis. In fact, some of the best MVPs don’t involve writing a single line of code. How can this be? Let’s take an example. Suppose you want to test the following hypothesis: “Twitter users would be interested in a product that enables them to queue up tweets for later posting.” This is exactly the hypothesis that Buffer.com started with when they designed their MVP, which consisted of two static web pages. The first page described the product and displayed a link to pricing information. When users clicked on the pricing link, a second page explained that the product wasn’t ready yet and displayed a field for the user to add their email to a waiting list. These two simple pages were enough to validate Buffer’s hypothesis and convince them to build a second MVP to test pricing. Ultimately the company went on to launch a very successful product. This type of MVP is known as a landing page MVP. Here are some other popular types:
Wizard of Oz – This approach combines minimal amounts of software on the front end with humans on the backend to fulfil customer requests. Customers interact with the software without realizing that most of the functionality is being performed by people. A famous example is the Zappos MVP.
Concierge MVP – This approach is identical to a Wizard of Oz MVP, except it uses little or no software and the customer is fully aware they are interacting with a human.
Piecemeal MVP – In this approach, existing software products are used to simulate the experience of the final product. For example, if you are planning to build a group dieting app, you might create a Facebook group to test hypotheses about peer to peer interactions. With piecemeal MVPs, you can also combine multiple software products to create an even more realistic simulation.
Hypotheses Definition
An MVP is an experiment. Its purpose is to test hypotheses about the problem you are targeting, your proposed solution or both. To define your hypotheses, follow these steps:
Determine which risks areas to focus on – Decide which of the four risk areas your MVP will assess. While you can assess any type of risk with an MVP, they are best for assessing value risk and business viability risk. Unless your MVP has a high degree of fidelity or is designed to solve complex technical problems, you should not use it for assessing usability or feasibility risk.
Define your hypotheses – Define at least one hypothesis to test. You can test as many you like but we recommend a limit of five to keep things manageable. Each hypothesis should target at least one of the risk areas you chose. As discussed, you should test your riskiest hypotheses first to avoid major risks from cropping up later on.
Define your validation criteria – This is how you will determine whether a hypothesis was valid or not. For example, with the Buffer MVP, the percent of visitors who sign up for the wait list could be one of our validation criteria.
Define your target values – This is the threshold for each validation criteria that you feel will validate your hypothesis. In the Buffer example, we might decide that a 25% conversion rate is necessary to validate the hypothesis.
Here are examples of hypotheses from an actual MVP that was designed to test an employee training solution:
Source: Launch Lab
Expand
MVP Testing
Once you have designed your MVP and defined your hypotheses, the next step is inviting customers to use it. Unless you need a large, statistically valid sample, a few dozen customers is probably sufficient. Here are some suggestions on recruiting:
Invite your interview subjects – If you performed customer discovery interviews, you probably already have a list of potential customers who fit your target profile.
Use social media – Tell friends, family and colleague know about your MVP on social media.
Facebook ads – Facebook is an excellent way to affordably target specific market segments. In addition to recruiting, you can also experiment with potential marketing tactics by varying ad copy and design. By tracking ad spend and conversions, you may even be able to forecast your customer acquisition cost.
Search marketing – If you envision users someday finding your product through search, recruiting MVP users through search ads can be very effective and affordable.
Lastly, before launching, test your MVP with teammates, friends and family to make sure the user experience is as expected and you are able to capture the necessary data to validate your hypotheses.  Even then, you may want to invite customers slowly to make sure everything is working and you have time to pay adequate attention to the incoming data.
Points to Consider
Multiple MVPs are common – Your first MVP may not give you the confidence to start building your product. In that case, feel free to keep experimenting. You can iterate on an existing MVP by making design changes or changing the recruiting criteria. Or you can launch an entirely new MVP.
Maintain a minimal mindset – The goal of any MVP is to maximize learning at the lowest possible cost. As you design your MVP, always ask “Is there a way to make this even simpler?”
Don’t get hung up on definitions – You will find lots of debate about the definition of an MVP and the different types of MVPs. Don’t let this stop you from forming hypotheses and finding creative ways to validate them.

Product Strategy
Introduction
In this course we will show you how to define a product strategy that will help you reach your product goals as quickly and efficiently as possible. Before you start, please note the following:
This course was designed primarily with technology products in mind, but the information here can also be applied to other types of products.
This course presents a sequence of steps that a product manager would typically follow. However, every product and team is different so we encourage you to adapt this process as needed. Feel free to choose your own sequence or even skip certain steps if you feel they don’t apply to you.
What is Product Strategy?
A strategy is a set of principles that a company uses to guide decision making in pursuit of a major goal. Companies can have corporate strategies, sales strategies, marketing strategies and, of course, product strategies. The main purpose of a product strategy is to enable a team to reach its product goals as quickly and efficiently as possible. We call this set of goals the product vision.
One way to think about product strategy is using the metaphor of a road trip. Your ultimate destination is your product vision, but what route do you take to get there? The map reveals dozens of options, but you have to pick just one. How do you choose? Weather might be one factor. The car you drive might be another. Similarly, your product strategy will depend on a variety of factors that we will review in this course. These include your business goals, target customer, competition and more.
Another way to think about product strategy is that it connects your product vision to the features you will need to build in order to achieve it.
Source: Launch Lab
Expand
As you can see from this diagram, product strategy is a necessary precursor to defining the functionality of your product.
Lastly, as this quote illustrates, strategy is all about focus:
Good strategy requires leaders who are willing and able to say no to a wide variety of actions and interests. Strategy is at least as much about what an organization does not do as it is about what it does.
- Richard Rumelt, UCLA Anderson School of Management
Designing your product to please every customer or every person in your organization will inevitably result in a watered down approach that leads nowhere. Defining a focused strategy and sticking to it in the face of challenges requires discipline. This means strategy is as much about leadership as it is analytical thinking.
Points to consider
Don’t confuse strategy with tactical deliverables like product plans, roadmaps and feature lists. These will inevitably change as you develop your product, whereas your strategy should remain constant.
It's acceptable to revise your strategy in the face of new data, or even to scrap it all together if the data reveals that it's destined to fail. However, such changes should not be taken lightly. Frequent strategic shifts will cause fatigue and confusion on your team. Moreover, validating your strategy may take longer than you think, and premature changes may result in the abandonment of a perfectly sound strategy that wasn’t given enough time to play out. If you have already launched your product and are concerned that your strategy is flawed, the first thing you should do is “get out of the building” and talk to some target customers using the interview technique we discussed earlier.
Strategy requires making tough choices. This can be hard and even scary at times. If you find it easy to develop and implement your strategy, it probably means you're trying to please too many customer segments or internal stakeholders. Without a clearly defined strategy, you risk saying “yes” to every feature request, ultimately pleasing no one.

Product Strategy Overview, Marty Cagan
STEP ONE: Define Your Product’s Goals
The first step in defining your product strategy is to set measurable, time-bound goals. These can range from competitive in nature (e.g. “become the number one selling app in our market within 24 months”) to the financial (e.g. “achieve 30% gross margins by Q3).
Above all, your product goals should:
Map to your company’s overall goals and mission
Align with your target customers’ needs
Be understood and agreed upon by your internal stakeholders
Points to Consider
Don’t overdo it – Having too many goals makes them harder for your team to track, communicate and internalize.
Be open to change – Goals often change when a product reaches the market and you obtain feedback from customers that you did not expect.
Data availability isn't always a given – Before proposing any goal, make sure you’ll be able to capture the necessary data to measure your progress. You can learn more about this topic in our Measurement module.
Consider how the various functional areas in your organization benefit from your product. Are their metrics represented in your product goals?
The success of any business relies on customer acquisition and retention, so always cross-check your business goals against these needs.

Step Two: Define Your Target Customer(s)
A strong product strategy requires a very clear and specific definition of your target customer. Everyone on your team should be able to clearly envision who they are designing the product for. This common understanding is also crucial for functions such as sales and marketing. The most frequently used approach is called market segmentation. This enables you to define your customer along three primary axes:
Demographic – This approach focuses on attributes like age, location, gender and religion. An example of a demographic segmentation would be “28-34 year old suburban women.”
Psychographic – Use this approach to identify customers based on their motivations, lifestyle or psychological profile. For example you may want to target people who are motivated by business success, or moms who are concerned about the health of their families.
Behavioral – With this approach you can identify customers who engage in specific activities or purchase certain products. For example, “people who use Microsoft Word” or “owners of luxury vehicles.”
Unless you are an expert on the customer you are targeting, the best way to identify your target customer is to use the interview and survey techniques we discussed earlier.
Points to Consider
Combine multiple segments for more specific targeting – Don’t hesitate to combine multiple segmentation approaches to increase the specificity of your targets. For example, Tesla might describe its target customer as a “32-42 year old man who owns a luxury car and likes to be seen as a technology expert.”
Bring your targets to life – Create personas for each of your targets. This approach enables you to depict your customer with photos, a backstory and detail about their preferences, jobs, family and other relatable attributes.
Don’t boil the ocean – It's tempting to target the broadest possible market, but try to limit yourself to four targets at most. Focusing on a single target can also be a good strategy. Successful products are often designed for a passionate niche and spread quickly from there.
Be open to change – Targets often change as a product gains adoption among different segments. You may be surprised by the types of customers who adopt your product and the ways they use it.
Be ready to prioritize – Sometimes delays or other unforeseen challenges will force product teams to narrow their focus. If necessary, would you be able to prioritize your targets based on revenue potential or other attributes?
Don’t forget customer acquisition cost – Make sure it is economically feasible to acquire each target as a customer. If you have doubts, consider other targets that are easier to acquire. Sometimes this can be as simple as narrowing your segmentation to identify a sub-segment that has a greater need for your product.
Consider targeting influencers – Consider targets that can help market your product through influence and word of mouth, or by acting as reference customers. These early adopters often prove more lucrative in the long run than those that are more lucrative from a short term revenue standpoint.

STEP THREE: Identify Your Customers’ Needs
Your product has no value unless it solves a problem for the customer. To succeed in the market, your product must also solve these problems better than what they are using now (by one estimate a successful product must be 10x better than the status quo in order to break through). Therefore, you need to identify which “pain points” your product can address. If you know the customer well, these may be obvious. If not, you will need to uncover them through research, analysis and experimentation, a process known as “discovery,” which is discussed in further detail here <<link to Discovery course>>.
Points to Consider
Get out of the building - If you don't already know your customer, learn more about them through the product discovery techniques such as surveys, interviews and prototyping.
Visualize their journey – Create a customer journey map to identify current pain points. You can also perform a day in the life analysis to visualize how your customer moves through their day.
Think big – Look for opportunities to create a 10x better experience for your customer compared to the products or methods they currently use.
Practice empathy – Adopt a mindset that puts you in the customer’s shoes when making decisions about how to design your product. This may be challenging at first, but after a while it will become second nature.

STEP FOUR: Analyze The Competitive Landscape
Your product strategy must also take into account the environment in which your product will compete. We call this the competitive landscape. Broadly speaking, it has three components:
Products that directly compete with yours
Substitutes that fill some or all of your customer's needs
Factors that affect the competitive dynamics of your industry, such as government regulation, the cost of labor, and the overall economy.
Analyzing competitors and substitutes will help you decide which problems and features to focus on. It will also help you anticipate their strategy and maintain your lead. To use a sports metaphor this is like preparing for a game by studying the players. Analyzing competitive dynamics will help you understand the underlying forces that give rise to competition. This is akin to studying the weather and field conditions before a game.
Start by creating a grid or matrix with your product in the left hand column. List your product’s key features or the pain points it solves for your target customer. Then add columns for each competitor and substitute.

Now, study the resulting grid. Where does your product outperform? Where does it lag behind? Highlight these areas and consider where you might need to add features and where you can cut back to save time and money.
Next, take some time to study the competitive forces that may be influencing the behavior of each player. There are a variety of frameworks to help you do this. The most popular are SWOT analysis, Five-Forces analysis and PESTL analysis. Click the links below to learn more about these.
Points to Consider
Get out of the building – Use customer discovery interviews and surveys to learn what products your target customers are using, and what they like and dislike about them.
Use vertical industry databases to find competitors – Unless you have extensive experience in the market you are entering, creating an exhaustive list of competitors can be challenging. A series of Google searches should uncover most, but you can build a more exhaustive list by searching software-specific databases like Crunchbase, Capterra, G2 and Angel List. Its also commonplace to miss some potential competitors. Your list will grow more complete over time.
Make a habit of competitive analysis – For highly competitive or fast-changing industries, competitive analysis can be time consuming. To stay abreast of the market, dedicate an hour or two each month to updating your list, but don’t feel compelled to track the every move of each competitor. It's far more important to focus on your product and your customers than the competition.
Share your analysis – Your competitive landscape analysis is also a valuable tool for your sales and marketing teams. Make sure to get their input and keep them updated regarding any major changes.

STEP FIVE: Define Your Competitive Advantage
To achieve your product vision and create long-term success, you will need to build one or more competitive advantages into your product. Sometimes these are referred to as a “moat” or “barriers to entry.”  Being first to market or having the best product is rarely sufficient to win over the long term. Betamax and MySpace are just two examples of such products.  
Broadly speaking there are two ways to build your product’s moat:
Quality – Depending on the type of product, quality can be measured in several ways, such as better features, performance, reliability or aesthetics. But because quality is often hard to judge before actually using a product, a customer’s perception of quality is often based on reputation or brand which can be expensive and slow to build.  
Price –  Unlike quality, price is easy for customers to assess. Therefore, low price can be a very effective way to quickly capture market share. 
Flywheels – A flywheel is any component of your product that increases the size of your moat over time as you succeed. We will discuss flywheels in greater detail below.
Flywheels
Unless you have access to valuable intellectual property or significant cost advantages for labor, materials or other inputs, competing on features or price will provide only short term advantages. This is why we encourage you to build flywheels into your strategy. Here are some examples:
Network effects – Network effects occur when your product becomes more valuable to customers as the number of users grows. For example, Fax machines had little value until enough people owned them to make sending faxes a convenient form of communication. Then, over time, the value of each fax machine grew as they became more common.
Platform strategy – Platforms are products that create value by facilitating exchanges between customers. Marketplaces like Ebay, Airbnb and app stores are one example. Social networks, like Facebook are another. In all cases, the product’s moat grows with the number of users and interactions.
Data effects – With technology products, the accumulation of data over time can create extremely large moats. For example, Facebook has enormous amounts of data on each user, which is then used by advertisers to target ads. The more data Facebook obtains, the more it can charge for ads and the harder it becomes for other platforms to compete.
Economies of scale – Economies of scale occur when it becomes cheaper to provide your product as demand grows. For example, a car manufacturer receives increasingly large volume discounts on parts as they manufacture more vehicles.
Switching costs – Switching costs make it hard for customer to replace a competitor’s product with yours, and they typically increase over time. Products with steep learning curves, such as complex software, often have high switching costs. Switching costs are also high with products that improve over time as they gather more data about users, then utilize that data to improve the user’s experience. Examples include Netflix, Spotify and Youtube.
Points to Consider
Flywheels can be combined – The best products combine multiple flywheels. For example, Facebook combines network effects, switching costs and platform strategy. The iPhone combines economies of scale with switching costs.
Flywheels can take time – Its OK to start by competing on price or quality, but you should plan to build in at least one flywheel into your product in the future. Gathering feedback from customers can be enormously helpful to this process so don’t delay your launch just because you haven’t figured out your flywheel strategy.

STEP SIX: Define Your Product Vision
Now that you have a clear picture of your customer, competitors and competitive strategy, it's time to define your product vision.
The product vision brings your product’s long term goals to life in a compelling, persuasive way. A good product vision serves several important functions:
Guides your team’s decision-making as you move through the development process.
Enables your team and other stakeholders to align around a shared vision.
Inspires and motivates internal and external stakeholders to help manifest the vision.
There are no rules on how to communicate your vision. One of the simplest approaches is to write a statement using the following format: 
For (target customer) who (statement of need or opportunity), the (product name) is a (product category) that (key benefit, reason to buy). Unlike (primary competitive alternative), our product (statement of primary differentiation).*
Here’s how Microsoft used this approach to communicate their vision for the Surface tablet: 
For the business user  who needs to be productive in the office and on the go, the Surface is a convertible table that is easy to carry and gives you full computing productivity no matter where you are. Unlike laptops, Surface serves your on-the-go needs without having to carry an extra device
Alternatively, you can create a slide presentation, a prototype, even a video like the one Apple created for their Knowledge Navigator product. Whatever format you use, the important thing is to find an approach that is tailored for your product and audience to create maximum impact.
Points to Consider
Choose an appropriate timeframe – A product vision that's focused too far in the future will be harder to relate to and may seem unattainable. A shorter timeframe may feel unambitious and uninspiring. For most technology products, a 3-5 year timeframe strikes the right balance.
Be specific – The more detailed your vision, the more believable it will be and the better it will serve as a guide for strategic decision making. Don’t shy away from details like user personas, use cases and design elements.
Be bold – Don’t be afraid to predict the future in ways that may make you uncomfortable today. As you craft your vision, try to imagine how your product will change your customers lives, your industry and even society as a whole.

Product Roadmaps
Introduction
In this course you will learn the importance of product roadmaps and how to create and use them. 
What is a Product Roadmap? 
A product roadmap is a visual depiction of your product’s journey from its current state to a future version. The format is essentially an XY graph that plots product attributes on the Y-axis against an X-axis representing time.
Roadmaps can be created for either external or internal consumption. The former are typically shared with customers to help them anticipate when certain features will be available. This type of roadmap is typically very specific with regards to feature breakdowns and dates. Our focus in this article is the internal kind, which are less specific, leaving teams more freedom to define features and set priorities over time.
Example of high level roadmap. 
Example of a detailed roadmap. 
Why Create Product Roadmaps?
Product roadmaps can be an extremely valuable tool for creating shared product understanding within an organization and marshalling the necessary support from different functional groups. More specifically they serve three main functions:
Help communicate your product strategy and vision –  Product teams use a variety of tools to communicate their product vision, such as slide decks, vision statements and prototypes, but these only tell part of the story. Product roadmaps provide important context and specificity by describing the product’s evolution over time.
Communicate priorities – The time scale or x-axis of a product roadmap is a statement about priorities. Items on the left side of the timescale are delivered sooner and are therefore higher priority than those on the right.
Convey time-based commitments – While roadmaps should not be viewed as an agreement to specific features and dates (more on this later), they do provide the broader organization with a sense of a product team’s high-level commitments.  This can help executive management provide better oversight and help sales and marketing teams plan their activities. 
What Roadmaps Are Not
It’s tempting to treat roadmaps as a kind of feature list or spec, but you should avoid this.  Your roadmap should be concise and big picture. It should tell a story about your key objectives, not the tactics you’ll use to achieve them.  This is important for several reasons:
Product teams are more engaged and productive when they have the freedom to define their own solutions and set their own priorities. And since the product team is typically closest to the customer, they are in the best position to make these decisions.
Product teams shouldn’t be measured solely on their ability to deliver features. A feature must also deliver value by solving the customer’s problem and helping the company meet its business goals. 
Your current assumptions about which features are needed may be wrong.  Learning is inevitable as you receive customer feedback. Your roadmap should enable you to embrace change, not resist it.
While a roadmap depicts time, it can’t predict the future. Until your product design is complete and you have buy-in from engineering, its impossible to know precisely when you will release a given feature. 
STEP ONE: Define Epics 
In the Product Scoping module we discussed the concepts of the product backlog, user stories and epics. A typical product backlog might contain hundreds of user stories and because the roadmap is meant to be concise, it would be impossible to display all of them. However, the typical backlog contains far fewer epics. Therefore the first step in creating your roadmap is to combine your user stories into epics.
Points to Consider
To ensure your roadmap has enough detail while still being concise, aim for between 15-25 epics.
For this exercise we recommend creating a spreadsheet with columns for each epic and the user stories it contains. This way you can easily sort and filter by epic.
Deliverables
A list of epics that describe your products functionality as it evolves and matures over time. 
STEP TWO: Choose a Timescale 
It's important to choose the right time scale, or x-axis, for your roadmap. But first you need to know that when it comes to time scales there are two types of roadmaps: specific and non-specific.  Date-specific roadmaps display time increments such as weeks, months or quarters. Non-specific roadmaps display looser categories like “Now, Next, Later.” 
The approach you choose depends on several factors: (1) the complexity of your product; (2) your knowledge of the technical and design problems you’ll need to solve;  (3) the degree to which your organization follows agile vs. waterfall practices; (4) the demands of your customers, industry or executives for timely delivery.  In general, if you are developing a complex product in an agile environment, you’re better off with a non-specific timeline, or a timeline based on a large time increment like quarters. This gives your product team the opportunity to discover the best solutions for the customer’s problems without being forced to follow an arbitrary schedule.
Month-by-month timescale
Non-specific timescale
Points to Consider
It's tempting to provide a specific timescale in order to please customers and internal stakeholders, but unless you are highly confident in your ability to deliver on time, you should avoid doing this because your team’s credibility and morale will be affected by delays.
Product management tools like ProductBoard and Roadmunk enable you to expand and collapse timescales. This can be a useful way to share roadmaps that cover longer periods of time.
Deliverables
A choice of time scale that fits the needs of your product and organization. 
STEP Three: Create Your Roadmap
Now that you have a timescale and a set of epics, it's time to create your roadmap by arranging your epics on the timeline. At this point, you may be wondering what tools to use.  Because the process of creating roadmaps is usually iterative and your roadmap will surely change over time, it's best to choose a tool that enables you to update your roadmap easily.  The options fall into three basic categories:
Presentation applications (e.g. Powerpoint, Keynote, Google Slides) –  These tools provide maximum control over your layout and design, but will make your roadmap harder to update compared to the other options below.
Spreadsheets  (e.g. Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers) – Spreadsheets are easier to update than slides but provide fewer design options. 
Dedicated applications (e.g. Aha!, Roadmonk, ProdPlan) – These tools provide a balance between attractive design and ease of updating. They also typically enable you to expand and contract epics, and include features for other product management tasks, such as prioritization and gathering customer feedback. However, there are some downsides to be aware of:  (1) You and your team will experience a ramp-up period while you are learning these tools; (2) They typically impose restrictions on the layout of your roadmap whereas spreadsheets and presentation tools allow for infinite flexibility.
Whichever tool you choose, the process of creating your roadmap is identical:
Prioritize your epics based on release sequence. To do this, simply arrange them top to bottom with the highest priority epics on top. For example:



Assign a point on your timescale for each epic. In doing so, try to be realistic about timing without going overboard. At this point you simply don’t have enough information about design and development complexity to set specific dates.  Also your customer’s needs should dictate timing as much, if not more, than your development schedule. For example: 


Points to Consider
Make sure your tools and roadmap structure will allow you to easily make updates in the future.
To further organize your roadmap, consider dividing your epics into themes. For example, going back to our car example, you could group all safety-related epics under a “Safety” theme and all performance related epics under a “Performance” theme.



At this point you should be ready to share your roadmap with your product team and the broader organization.  Ask for their feedback and if they have any questions or concerns.  Ultimately, you want to make sure they understand the journey you have mapped out and are ready to support you.

Product Design 
Introduction
“Design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose.” 
Charles Eames, American designer, architect, and filmmaker
If you have taken our Product Discovery and Product Strategy courses, you should have a  good idea by now about what to build and for whom. Moreover, you should have an inspiring product vision with clear goals and a strategy to create a sustainable competitive advantage. If so, the next step is to design your product. 
This course will teach you important design concepts that will save you time and money as you move through the design phase. Before you start, please note the following:
This course was designed primarily with technology products in mind, but the information here can also be applied to other types of products.
This course presents a sequence of steps that a product manager would typically follow. However, every product and team is different so we encourage you to adapt this process as needed. Feel free to choose your own sequence or even skip certain steps if you feel they don’t apply to you. 
What is Product Design? 
Product design has numerous definitions. While some definitions include product discovery, we will assume it starts after an initial discovery phase has been completed. Some definitions also include parts of the product that are invisible to the user, like algorithms, but for our purposes we will only include what the user can see, hear or otherwise sense. Product design also encompasses many separate areas of design. Here are some terms you may encounter:
User interface design – Also called “UI design,” this is the practice of creating ways for users to interact with a product.
User experience design – Also called “UX design,” this type of design attempts to optimize the user’s experience across all touchpoints, not just the product itself. These might include packaging, customer support and service.
Visual design – The process of choosing of colors, fonts, icons and other visual details that add polish to a screen or web page.
Interaction design – The design of animations, sounds, vibrations and other sensory cues that result from a user’s interaction with a product.
Workflow design - The way that individual features are connected in a path, or the path through a single feature.
Feature design – The arrangement of components that comprise a single feature.
Putting Users First 
The goal of product design is to transform raw ideas into a tangible and unified whole that helps achieve your product goals. While it was not always the case, today there is universal agreement that the best way to approach this process is by putting the user first. This is sometimes referred to as user-centered design, human-centered design or design thinking.  Putting users first means thinking deeply about their needs. We can visualize these as a pyramidal hierarchy starting with the most important needs at the base.
Functional – Does your product enable the user to achieve their goals?
Reliable – Does the product function as expected on consistent basis?
Pleasureable – Does the product elicit positive emotions? 
Pleasureable – Does the product elicit positive emotions? 

Design is Good Business
If you want your product to succeed in the market, you should care deeply about its design. During the past 20 years we have seen an explosion of design-driven products and companies and the evidence is clear: good design is good business. In fact, according to one study, design-centric companies outperformed the S&P 500 by 228%.  And we can see this impact all around us in companies like Apple and Airbnb whose products weren’t first to market, but wound up dominating their markets through good design.  The increasing prevalence of good design has now created an expectation in users that whatever product they choose will live up to the design standards they have become accustomed to.  This means, now more than ever, your product must be well designed in order to compete.

“Good Artists Copy; Great Artists Steal”
– Unknown
Product design isn’t easy but due to the explosion of good design, you are in a fortunate position: there are now many well-designed products you can draw upon for inspiration during your design process. You can even take this approach a step further by copying existing designs. This may sound unethical, but this is a common practice that is achieved using an approach called “UI patterns.”  UI Patterns are repeatable solutions to common design problems. You can find patterns for simple features such as sign up, sign in, log in and log in, but also more complex ones like recommendation engines and user dashboards.  Not only will UI patterns save you time and money, but they will increase the likelihood that your product is both usable and pleasurable. This is because your customer uses many other products on a regular basis that also follow these patterns. User behavior is hard to change so if you deviate from standard patterns, you are forcing your customer to learn a new way of interacting which may result in dissatisfaction or even abandonment of your product.
Points to Consider
Product design has numerous definitions. While some definitions include product discovery, we will assume it starts after an initial discovery phase has been completed. Some definitions also include parts of the product that are invisible to the user, like algorithms, but for our purposes we will only include what the user can see, hear or otherwise sense. Product design also encompasses many separate areas of design. Here are some terms you may encounter:
Sometimes design innovation is necessary  – If you are trying to solve a design problem and there is no established pattern, you should innovate, but make sure to test your design with your target customer and iterate as needed until you have mitigated as much risk as possible.
Look across industries –  Products that solve similar problems in other industries can be an excellent source of design inspiration. This approach can also provide a significant competitive advantage by enabling you to innovate within your industry without the risk of creating a new design pattern from scratch.

Platform Selection
One of the most important decisions you will make when designing your product is your choice of platforms.  A platform is a special type of product: one that enables the creation or delivery of other products. The most widely used are the dominant smartphone and personal computing platforms: Apple’s, IOS, Google’s Android, and Microsoft Windows. Other major platforms include smart speakers like Amazon’s Echo, and TV-centric platforms like Roku. Looking to the future, popular platforms may one day include glasses, headsets, or even chip implants. Due to the disparate nature of these platforms, the optimal design for your product will vary significantly depending on the platform you choose. In addition, the functionality of your product may also need to vary for different platforms. Therefore technology products often have to undergo expensive modifications to work on more than one platform. This is just one reason why choosing the right platform is a crucial step in your product design process. In the next section, we will explore other factors.
Choosing a Platform
Platform selection can be complex, but if you take a strategic approach you can narrow down the choices considerably.  Here are the primary factors you should consider:
Audience – How many of your target customers does the platform provide access to? For products with universal appeal, it may make sense to choose one of the dominant platforms. For special purpose products, the choice of platform should be driven by the access they provide to your target customer.
Time to market – As discussed, early identification of risks is crucial to product success. Therefore, as you choose a platform you should consider the amount of time it will take to bring your product to market. For example, since mobile app development takes much longer than website development, it is common for products to launch first on the web.
Cost - How much does it cost to develop or operate your product? Development costs include designers, engineers and testers. Operating costs include app store fees and software licenses.
User experience – Will your chosen platform enable you to create a functional, reliable, usable and pleasurable product? Also consider the ease of access to your product that each platform offers. For example, a website is relatively easy to access –  simply click a lick, perform a search or type an address. Now compare this to installing a mobile phone app: the user must launch the app store, find the app and often enter a password or credit card before they can finally download it.
Ease of proliferation – How much opportunity does the platform offer for your product to spread? For example, users can easily find smartphone apps through app store and internet searches. App stores also provide algorithmic recommendations.  By contrast, it is much harder for users to discover new applications on smart speaker devices.  Also consider the opportunity for your product to spread virally within or across platforms. Using our previous example, it’s relatively easy for users to share smartphone apps and websites but much harder to share smart speaker applications.
Points to Consider
Prioritize your platforms – It is rare to launch a new product on multiple platforms.  Even large companies will usually release a new product on a single platform to gauge customer response and obtain feedback. Therefore, you should try to limit your first release to one platform and use the feedback you receive to plan your next one.
Consider emerging platforms – Sometimes it pays develop your product for newer platforms that may not be widely used now, but are growing in popularity.  You will face less competition and as the platform grows you will have the opportunity to build a strong reputation and platform expertise.

Product Scoping 
Product scoping is the process of deciding what to include and exclude from your product. Scoping is especially important when launching a new product because time and money are at a premium. Proper scoping enables you to reach your product goals as quickly and efficiently as possible.
Waterfall vs. Agile
Until the mid 2000’s product scoping usually involved creating a prioritized list of features. The team would then estimate the cost of developing each feature and how far down the list they could afford to develop given their available time and resources. This was known as the waterfall approach because the entire product scope would be sent to engineering, and then to testing in a waterfall-like fashion before a final release could occur many months later.
Since then, a methodology called agile that uses an iterative approach to scoping has become dominant. Instead of planning the entire scope in advance, development is performed in short bursts called sprints. Working software is released after each sprint and the scope is subject to change as the team receives feedback on each release.
User Stories and Epics
Another impact of agile is that feature specifications have been largely replaced by user stories. User stories are one sentence scenarios that describe the problem that a feature is supposed to solve and for whom.  For example, suppose you are designing a braking system for a car and your target customers live in snowy areas. Your user story might go something like this:  “As a driver I need the ability to stop my car quickly in the snow in order to avoid accidents.”
Stories are often combined together into larger groups called epics. Going back to our car example, suppose we need to ensure the car can brake safely under other adverse conditions such as rain, sleet and unpaved roads. We could then create user stories for each of these conditions and group them into an epic called “Safe Braking.”
The Product Backlog
Another key agile concept is the product backlog. This is simply a prioritized list of user stories with the most important stories at the top. With each development cycle, stories are handed off to the development team for execution. When feedback is received, the backlog is re-prioritized or “groomed.”  There are many prioritization techniques you can use. Some of the most popular are MOSCOW, RICE and story mapping.
Using an agile approach, it's obviously impossible to predict what your backlog will look like from sprint to sprint because the process is iterative. However, you should prioritize your backlog as best you can in alignment with your product goals and vision. Even though it may change over time, this will give your team a firm baseline to work from.  Remember, the first version of your product won’t include every user story, so as you build your backlog limit your focus to the first few iterations of your product.

Measurement
“If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.”
-Peter Drucker
Measurement may not seem related to design but gathering the right data from users is crucial to improving your design after it launches. And knowing in advance what to measure not only improves your ability to capture the right data, but can also result in a more effective design. This is because framing your product goals in numerical terms forces you to think about the user behaviors you want to encourage and how the different parts of the user experience contribute to them.
Let’s take an example. Suppose you are designing a social media app and the behavior that you want to encourage is getting users to post frequent updates. In that case, your design might include sending weekly reminders to users who haven’t posted in awhile, and a large, colorful “post” button to attract their attention. 
Once you have identified your desired user behaviors, the next step is to determine how you will measure them and set targets, as follows:
Define KPIs – KPI stands for “Key Performance indicator.”  These are the metrics that your product design should optimize.  For example, with our social media app we would certainly want to include a KPI that enables us to measure our success in getting users to post frequently. One such KPI might be the number of posts per user per month. Another might be the percent of users who click on the weekly reminders.
Set Targets – Once we know what to measure, setting targets for these measurements helps us further optimize our design. For example, suppose we set an ambitious target for our monthly posts KPI. That might lead us toward further optimizations such as animating the button and increasing the frequency of the reminders.
Conversion Funnels
Conversion funnels are an important concept when it comes to measurement and optimization.  A conversion funnel is the path through your product that a user takes toward some desired outcome. They’re called funnels because the flow of users is almost always funnel-shaped: the largest number of users are at the top and the funnel narrows towards the bottom as usage drops off. When thinking of your design as a funnel, your goal is to remove steps and other sources of friction in order to retain as many users as possible as they move through the funnel.
Points to Consider
Use KPIs sparingly -  Having too many KPIs makes it harder for your team to track, communicate and internalize them. You should aim for between five and ten KPIs. 
KPIs are subject to change – As you learn more about your customer, your market and your product, it's likely that one or more of your original KPIs will become outdated and will need to be replaced. Therefore, don’t worry too much about finding the perfect KPIs and don’t cling too tightly to KPIs that aren’t serving the needs of your product.

Introduction to Corporate Accelerators
In an age of innovation, even large corporations must be entrepreneurial. Established organizations and startups can clearly help each other, but collaboration between them has not always been fruitful. According to the joint research report The State of Corporate/Startup Collaboration by Imaginitak and MassChallenge: “While 86 percent of large organizations view innovation as crucial to their future, most of their current attempts to work with startups to further that objective are early stage, underfunded and scattershot, such that 25 percent of corporations aren’t even sure how much they’re spending.”
It’s not enough to buy your team some company hoodies or put a ping-pong table in the break room. Companies must have a concise and thoughtful plan to engage startups. Imaginitak/MassChallenge report that 82 percent of corporations view interactions with startups as at least somewhat important, and 23 percent called them “mission critical.” “Our research found that although nearly three-fourths of large companies (71 percent) reported successful collaboration with entrepreneurs, unfortunately little more than half of entrepreneurs (57 percent) agreed. This gap must be closed.” – Accenture, 2015.
Partnerships with startups are no longer nice things to have. They’re crucial.
Corporate accelerators represent a new frontier in the startup ecosystem. There’s no shortage of high-quality information about accelerators, but at this early stage, that information is scattered all over the internet. Finding impactful information in one place, organized and usable, has been difficult. Until now.
What follows is a curated resource for creating a corporate accelerator. Founders, mentors and alumni share wisdom in interviews and blog posts. Governments, organizations, and individual researchers collect and analyze data to determine accelerators’ impact and outcomes. And I, West Stringfellow, HowDo’s Founder and CEO, proposed, built, and managed a Techstars Accelerator at Target. I then took the learnings from Techstars and created several bespoke accelerators for Target. It is with this foundation in traditional accelerators and corporate innovation strategies, that this guide breaks down the core competencies necessary to tap into the entrepreneurial ecosystem via the accelerator.
Defining Startup Accelerators
The current trend in corporate innovation is startup engagement, but this terminology is confusing. Accelerators are described as incubators, and the institution that inspired this phenomenon (Y Combinator) calls itself a “new model for funding early stage startups.”
Researchers have tried to mitigate the confusion by clearly defining different startup support models. Two of the researchers on the forefront of accelerator research, Susan G. Cohen and Yael V. Hochberg, defined a seed accelerator as follows:
“A fixed-term, cohort-based program, including mentorship and educational components, that culminates in a public pitch event or demo-day.”
—Cohen, Susan and Hochberg, Yael V., Accelerating Startups: The Seed Accelerator Phenomenon (March 30, 2014). Available at SSRN https://ssrn.com/abstract=2418000 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2418000
Accelerators are sufficiently different from their incubator counterparts and other innovation tools. The chart below provides a visual representation of these distinctions.

Accelerators, then, are typically of limited duration—a period of immersive education. They help startups define and build products by identifying promising customer segments and by securing resources such as seed capital, employees, and work space.
A huge consideration for innovators and entrepreneurs is that accelerators open doors and networking opportunities. Program participants gain access to peers and mentors who include successful entrepreneurs, program graduates, venture capitalists, angel investors, and corporate executives.
A Short History of Modern Startup Accelerators
“Y Combinator is just accelerating a process that would have happened anyway.”
— Paul Graham, 2005
The accelerator concept didn’t emerge in a vacuum; rather, it is a concept that grew out of a need for an improved process behind VC investments.
In March of 2005, Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston came to the conclusion that current trends in VC investment were lacking. They suggested that VCs should make frequent, smaller investments, as opposed to fewer, larger investments. With the help of Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell, the team, under the name “Y Combinator,” started the Summer Founder’s Program to test out this theory.
The Summer Founder’s Program pulled from a mix of traditional seed funding and business-incubator traits. The program gave bright college students a chance to create something amazing with their friends while, at the same time, allowed Y Combinator to uncover an important new strategy for venture capitalists: making multiple, small, and synchronous investments across a cohort of startups. That first Summer Founder’s Program provided a spark that disrupted the investment world; It essentially created a system that gave venture capital the ability to scale.
Y Combinator created a system that:
Targeted a large number of startups, thereby distributing risk and increasing chances of breakout success;
Accelerated exits either through acquisition or cohort dropout; and
Improved over time as graduated cohorts came on as both mentors and investors in the system.
This new system did not go unnoticed. The early success of Y Combinator inspired other investors and, within several years, similar programs started to emerge. Early efforts included the following:
2005: Y Combinator first cohort
2007: Techstars first cohort
2007: SeedCamp first cohort
2008: Dreamit ventures first cohort
2008: AlphaLab first cohort
2009: Founder Institute first Cohort

Defining Corporate Accelerators
The corporate accelerator closely mirrors independent seed accelerators but there are important distinctions: the objectives of corporate accelerator programs are driven by corporate objectives and these programs are largely owned and run by organizations not traditionally in the business of working with startups.
There are also other differences between corporate and seed accelerator programs, processes, and outcomes.

As illustrated above, different tools are used to achieve specific goals. Accelerators are exploratory. The best results are seen after both networks and visibility have a chance to grow.

The Rise of Corporate Accelerators
Five years after the emergence of Y Combinator, corporations began to experiment with the accelerator model. Among the first corporate accelerators were Citrix (USA), ImmobilienScout (Germany), Microsoft (USA), and Telefónica (Spain).
This phenomenon emerged at a time when firms were holding on to record amounts of cash and were looking for low-risk growth opportunities in the wake of the Great Recession. Corporate accelerators allow companies to investigate startups that are aligned with their strategy while leveraging their current workforce and providing minimal capital. These factors, combined with the increasing interest in innovation among CEOs, created a fertile ground in which corporate accelerators thrived.
By 2016/2017, there were 188 total accelerators and 71 active corporate accelerators.

Advantages to Corporate Accelerators
Corporate accelerators exist at the sweet spot among a number of variables: risk level, capital investment, access to the external ecosystem, and engagement level. This positioning offers a wide variety of incentives for corporations.
Access to talent: Startups can provide a source of high-quality talent for the host corporation. Through an accelerator program, a corporation can observe startup teams and, upon completion of the cycle, potentially bring team members on board, either through an acquisition or by targeting specific team members.
Proximity to emerging technology and trends: Startups occur naturally at the cutting edge of technology. By immersing themselves in the startup ecosystem, corporations gain insights into new technologies and business models (among other things) that can be applied to other business segments.
Open-source R&D: Corporate accelerators provide a venue for multiple industry-specific experiments. Corporations can observe how new ideas succeed or fail without having to deal with the costs or logistical hurdles associated with traditional R&D.
Financial returns: If the corporation chooses an equity stake in a participating startup, the corporation may experience financial gains if the startup grows rapidly or is acquired. (Deloitte)
Innovative culture: When a corporation is engaged with the startup ecosystem, the entrepreneurial mindset rubs off on the company’s culture. Internal employees have the opportunity to become mentors, attend seminars, and interact with the startups. These new ideas help spur innovation throughout the company.
New partnerships: The creation of a corporate accelerator sends a signal that a corporation is committed to engaging in the external innovation system. Other corporations within the industry often seek guidance or partnerships with corporate acceleration leaders. (Forbes – Microsoft)
1: Choose the Design
Not all corporate accelerators are the same. According to Yael Hochberg in “Innovation Policy and The Economy,” there are five main variations of the corporate accelerator.
Corporate involvement in existing accelerators: Corporations and their executives join existing accelerators as mentors or investors.
Outsourcing accelerator creation: A corporation contracts with an independent group to run the accelerator on its behalf.
Joint accelerator partnerships: Corporations partner with other corporations to create joint accelerators (usually focused around an industry).
In-house accelerator with an external focus: Corporations create their own internally powered accelerator with outside applicants.
In-House accelerator with an internal focus: Corporations can create a completely internal program that accelerates internal teams.
Each of these models can succeed in an appropriate environment, but the selection of one model over another is dependent on the company’s needs and available resources. For instance, an in-house accelerator will be more expensive than a joint accelerator partnership. We investigate this issue deeper in the final section of this guide on accelerator management.
Model considerations by dimension

While corporate accelerators may seem like they are all the rage these days, they’re not always appropriate for every company—and they’re not the only option. Accelerators are just one tool the innovator can use to engage in the startup ecosystem. Explore other possible innovation tools here (add link).
Corporate accelerators must be tailored to the needs of the organization and its goals. Broadly speaking, there are four components to the design: Duration, Location, Sector, Learning.
2: Choose the Duration
“We discovered [the three-month program length] by accident. When we first started YC [Y Cobinator], we began with a summer program. We were trying to learn how to be investors, so we invited college students to come to Cambridge and start startups instead of getting summer jobs.”
— The F|R Interview: Y Combinator’s Paul Graham, Carleen Hawn, May 2008
The three-month program may of Y Combinator was discovered accidentally, and it created a new dimension of the startup that leverages the time constraint. However, although the most public accelerators (Y Combinator and Techstars) have chosen the three-month approach, you should design your programs according to the type of product you are focusing on and the amount of capital you have available.
Expand
Consider the Product Type 
The first thing for an accelerator to consider is what type of product is being developed. While tight deadlines can inspire action, startup founders need enough time to develop a demo product that they can pitch by the end of the program.
“Copying Y Combinator without a reason is a poor choice,” wrote Jed D. Christiansen in his MBA dissertation Copying Y Combinator. “New program founders should specifically think about the reasons behind the length of their accelerator program.”
The three-month window may be ideal for web or mobile applications with typically low capital requirements and short prototyping durations, but if a startup has to build a physical product, it’s going to need more time.
Consider Cost and Efficiency
“Part of the power of the accelerator is that it’s a constrained period of time.”
— Brad Feld and Ian Hathaway Discuss Accelerators, Ian Hathaway, September 2015
As Christiansen noted, most of the funded startups at Y Combinator are unable to launch in the three-month window before Demo Day, but the accelerator has stuck to that length. “We kept the three-month cycle because it is a good length of time to build a version 1,” Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham said,. “Some startups may not be able to launch in such a short time, but they should all be able to build something impressive.”
A short timeframe puts pressure on startups, but it has other benefits as well. “The limited duration is essential to controlling costs and increasing the number of startups in the accelerator’s portfolio,” wrote the authors of the Small Business Administration report “Innovation Accelerators: Defining Characteristics Among Startup Assistance Organizations.” “This in turn increases the expected profit of the accelerator by increasing the probability of one or more high value exits into the marketplace.”
3. Choose the Location
“There is a start-up revolution occurring. Every major metro area in the world will eventually be able to support an accelerator.” 
— Future Techstars, Step Forward, Max Chafkin, April 2012
There are generally two schools of thought when it comes to startup accelerator location. One school believes that startup accelerators can thrive anywhere. Brad Feld, who co-founded Techstars in Boulder, Colorado, wrote in Inc. Magazine that “A good accelerator can be run in any city in the world for $500,000.”
The other school believes that Silicon Valley is the best place in the world to house an accelerator. At the Etohum San Francisco 2015 event, Y Combinator’s Michael Seibel said, “We think it’s just ridiculously important to have YC in the [Silicon] Valley. I don’t think we’re ever going to launch an international chapter of YC. The advantages of the Valley are that we can introduce people to money and good valuations, we can introduce them to tons of other companies that can be mentors and customers, and we can introduce them to the pace of the Valley — the speed that you have to operate. We can’t do that anywhere else.”
Both schools agree that accelerators are more successful when they’re part of a thriving ecosystem. But while Graham says startups should seek out an industry or startup ecosystem, Feld argues that entrepreneurs can create their own.
“I’m not claiming, of course, that every startup has to go to Silicon Valley to succeed,” Graham wrote on his website. “Just that all other things being equal, the more of a startup hub a place is, the better startups will do there.”

Feld disagrees: “I think it’s unbelievably myopic to say the only place you can build your company is Silicon Valley or City X,” he told Marketplace. “It goes against the law of systems dynamics — if everyone goes to a certain place to do a certain thing, you’re not going to have increasing returns forever. You should decide where to live your life, and then build your life around that.”
It’s worth noting that Feld considers the startup process to have a longer timeframe than most entrepreneurs think about: “It takes 20 years to create a company,” he told the Wharton School in 2013. “The startup community needs that kind of 20-year time horizon.”
All this said, corporations are generally constrained to the areas where they already operate. Therefore, before moving forward with any accelerator plans, assess your city’s innovation and startup potential.

4. Choose the Sector
A major benefit of focusing on teams in one sector is that the ventures benefit from sharing expertise because they are working on related problems or technologies. Similar teams in one cohort also facilitate collaborating with investors and partners who are active in the particular sector.” 
— Corporate accelerators: Building bridges between corporations and startups, Thomas Kohler, 2016
The accelerator space is saturated with incumbents that have controlled the generic market for years. Most corporate accelerators have addressed their lagged entry by focusing on their specific vertical.
“By concentrating on one specific sector, the accelerator management team can develop the necessary sector-specific knowledge and expertise to identify and exploit the economic potential of entrepreneurial teams,” wrote the authors of the report “A Look Inside Accelerators” by the U.K. foundation Nesta.
Focusing on a corporation’s own industry allows an accelerator to take advantage of various synergies that can help a startup succeed. As the DEEP Centre report Global Best Practices in Business Acceleration noted, these can include global value chains, hands-on mentorship, and exposure to the corporate partner’s executives, employees and customers.
To date, two industries have dominated the growth in corporate accelerators. Half of the corporations that have launched accelerators are in technology, media, and telecom, while almost a quarter are in financial services. Both industries are being transformed by digital technologies.
“Corporations within these industries should pay particular attention to this emerging innovation model—as their competitors already are,” wrote John Ream and David Schatsky in Deloitte Insights. “Corporations in industries with lower accelerator adoption may want to explore the model as a distinctive innovation tactic that may help drive unique capabilities among their peers.”
In any industry, focusing on the sector correlates with startup success. A 2015 global survey on best practices in incubation and acceleration by Unitus Seed Fund and Capria Accelerator Fund found that 70 percent of startups in the top quartile of success “have a deep sector focus; the second and third quartile both have 50 percent who have a sector focus and only 10 percent of those in the lowest quartile of success have a sector focus.”
Corporations are in a prime position to provide startups with support in their respective industries. Innovation leadership must keep an ear to the ground and determine whether the industry is ripe for corporate support. The following are a small sample of resources for insights into disruptive trends.
Which leads to the next question: Is your sector ripe for disruption?

5: Design the Learning Process
“You’re just trying to accelerate time so in three months you’re trying to get two years’ worth of learning about your business to happen.”
— Brad Feld and Ian Hathaway Discuss Accelerators, Ian Hathaway, September 2015
Accelerators transform not only startups, but the founders themselves. To keep their heads above water, founders have to learn to move quickly. The learning dynamic within accelerators is complex. Anyone with the intention of building an accelerator would be wise to read Susan L. Cohen’s How to Accelerate Learning: Entrepreneurial Ventures Participating in Accelerator Programs. This study lays out a learning framework based on the structural elements of the accelerator. That includes directors, mentors, cohorts and teams, as well as how time constraints can affect learning.

Expand
Looking beyond the indirect learning factors, accelerators must plan some sort of education curriculum. While 97 percent of accelerators offer business skills training, training/education offered at accelerators is far from uniform. Effective training methods vary widely based on the topics covered, time spent in class, cohort size, location, etc.
What’s Workingin Startup Acceleration, a study of 15 Village Capital programs by the Global Accelerator Learning Initiative (GALI), found that high-performing programs spent less time working on finance, accounting, and formal business plan development and more time on presentation skills, communication skills, networking, organization structure. and design.
Image Source: GALI, 2016
Expand
Accelerators must focus on the practicalities of innovation, not the intricacies of double-entry bookkeeping. Many promising entrepreneurs don’t have access to resources because they don’t have the right networks. They didn’t go to the right schools or don’t speak the same language as emerging market investors. (This is part of the reason for HowDo; to provide a baseline for people to discuss innovation and growth. If you need help building a bespoke education program for your accelerator, Contact HowDo.)
So, while understanding financials is necessary for running a business, it’s not the best use of accelerators’ time. When planning the education curriculum, there should be less concern with the output and more focus on perfecting what goes into creating output that has value.
According to a Whitepaper by Impact Accelerator, startups most request courses on user experience, digital marketing, and SEO optimization.
Consider the Educational Program Structure
“Less is more’ when it comes to program content. Programs where entrepreneurs spend a lot of time in the classroom — listening to guest speakers or to us teaching — have inferior outcomes.”
— What’s Working in Startup Acceleration, GALI
When there’s teaching to do, it’s tempting to sit students down in a classroom and show them what they need to know. But GALI found that “the more remote work we allow, the better.” Indirect learning, which focuses on the student’s inquiry and exploration rather than the teacher’s instruction, allows entrepreneurs to learn while working on their business plan and product.
According to the authors of a research paper titled “Do Accelerators Accelerate? The Role of Indirect Learning in New Venture Development:” “Much of the benefits of accelerator participation likely stems from accelerators providing opportunities for indirect learning that help entrepreneurs correct known and unknown flaws and gaps in their initial business plans and identify unexpected possibilities for improvements (e.g., target customer, go-to-market plan, technology and operations strategy, profit formula).”
Accelerators should design curricula around things entrepreneurs do remotely that serve the dual function of teaching valuable lessons and helping advance the startup. Time on site is better used in building relationships.
Some accelerators are beginning to blend online education with the accelerator experience. This allows founders to spend more time building both networks and product.
Where the corporate accelerator is located and how many entrepreneurs it’s trying to serve will both influence the design of the curriculum.
“Accelerators that operate in regions without a strong history of entrepreneurship will need to create a more comprehensive educational program,” wrote Christiansen in Copying Y Combinator, “while accelerators that focus on more experienced entrepreneurs can likely be successful with a more tailored educational program.”
As in any other educational setting, the smaller the cohort, the more specialized and individual the teaching can be. But even in larger programs, it’s important that all entrepreneurs get some education tailored to their startup.
“In larger education programs, the advice must be biased toward the general in order to be effective,” Christiansen wrote. “But product-specific advice and education can be invaluable to the long-term success of a company, and should be included as a part of every accelerator program.”

Here are some examples of general entrepreneur education curricula aimed at larger, industry-agnostic cohorts.

Additionally, the smaller the cohort, the more specialized and individual the teaching can be. But all entrepreneurs require some education that is tailored to their startup.
6. Market Your Accelerator
Once a corporation understands what startups are hoping to get from your corporate accelerator, the marketing can begin. Managing expectations from the get-go saves everybody a lot of time. Clear communication about the program’s criteria, what it offers, and to whom, will help the startups understand what’s in it for them. This way, the corporation can be confident that any applicants are at least on board with the bare bones of the program.
Selecting the channels through which to deliver the message depends on where the company has influence. For example, Sam Altman of Y Combinator states that an online class he taught boosted the entrepreneur applicant rate by 40 to 50 percent. For another company, an alumni network might be a more lucrative channel.
According to the report Bridging the “Pioneer Gap” by the Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs and Village Capital, the most common sources accelerators cite for startups are:
1. Referrals from entrepreneurs affiliated with the accelerator.
2. Impact investors (individuals and investment funds).
3. Commercial investors (individuals and investment funds that do not self-identify as impact investors).
4. Entrepreneurial associations (fellowships, scholarships) in the social impact space.
5. Entrepreneurial associations that do not identify with social entrepreneurship or impact investing.
6. Universities.
7. Sector-specific industry associations.
8. Sector-specific conferences (e.g., agriculture, education).
9. Social entrepreneurship or impact-investing conferences.
10. Inbound requests from program marketing efforts and social media.Outbound direct, “cold call” recruitment (e.g., finding and contacting entrepreneurs on the web, Facebook, LinkedIn).
— Aspen Institute
The report notes, however, that not all sources are equally helpful, and a corporation should decide where its outreach efforts will get the most bang for the buck in terms of attracting quality applicants, not quantity.
Startupbootcamp, which runs accelerator programs around the world, published a Startup Ecosystem Analysis for the year 2016. The accelerator ran 266 mentorship events in 53 countries in 2016, nearly double the number from 2015. It also finds teams at major conferences and industry events. Startupbootcamp representatives attended more than 40 such events in 2016, including Pioneers Festival in Vienna, RISE in Hong Kong, and Wolves Summit in Warsaw.
The program also relies heavily on referrals. More than a quarter of Startupbootcamp’s startup teams came through referrals from mentors, alumni, investors, and staff members.

According to Altman, one of Y Combinator’s problems is that the top of their funnel is so large, and the sheer number of applicants so vast that the program risks discarding some of the good applicants with the bad.
The figure, below, shows the selection funnel for Impact Accelerator. In this case, of 160 million applicants, only 60 were selected.
Image Source: Impact Accelerator
Expand
The precursor to screening applicants is to develop selection criteria that are unique to the company-accelerator context. A case study by the Small Business Institute Journal examined leading accelerator companies in the United States. It found that each had a different set of criteria for selecting participants.
Expand
Selected startups or teams must have the elements necessary to succeed, including sufficient experience, a good product, a receptive market, and a plan. Even with these clear criteria, selecting startups to participate in an accelerator isn’t easy; accelerators that have been around for more than a decade admit that it’s messy and imperfect.
7: Select the Startups for Your Accelerator
Corporate accelerators should be selective about the startups they bring into their programs. Although receiving a flood of applications might seem like a way to cherry-pick the most promising candidates, according to the Unitus Seed Fund/Capria Accelerator Fund survey, the most successful accelerators put out significant effort to ensure a good fit.
Entrepreneurs participate in accelerators for a variety of reasons, but funding and connections are at the top of the list. In Jed D. Christiansen’s dissertation, Copying Y Combinator, the most popular reasons were connections to future capital, brand connections, business support, product support, and financial support and initial funding, in that order.
John Ream and David Schatsky more recently explored what attracts startups to corporate accelerators for Deloitte Insights. They found four driving factors:
Equity-free funding: It’s still common for corporations to acquire equity from startups they bring into their accelerators, but Deloitte’s analysis found that Samsung, Microsoft, and Google have all adopted equity-free funding, which is perhaps an indicator of the increasing demand for talent.
Industry-focused mentors: Mentors are crucial to a successful accelerator program, and startup founders often cite mentors as the single most important element. When corporations focus their accelerators on their own industry, entrepreneurs can tap into experts in the field, from executives and business unit leaders to product managers and technical experts.
Corporate resources: Access to proprietary resources can be a critical differentiator for an accelerator program. Qualcomm, Samsung, and Barclays all provide startups with data, internal tools, and intellectual property. These ready-to-use established resources are integral to rapid startup development.
Future customers: The corporate sponsor, and its market, are obvious early customers for a startup. Vending Analytics is a startup whose product uses data analytics to optimize vending machine stocking. The company was spawned by Coca-Cola’s Founders startup incubator, so it wasn’t surprising when Coke signed on to use the product. As a result, the soft-drink giant realized a 20 percent increase in revenue per machine.

Timeline for Selection
In terms of the timeline for the selection process, most accelerators spend between one and three months recruiting each new cohort, according to both Bridging the “Pioneer Gap.”and “Startup Accelerator Programmes: A Practice Guide.” One-third spend between three months and a year.
Selection processes have evolved over the years as accelerators have gained momentum within the startup community. As the numbers of applicants continue to increase, video applications and the use of alumni help weed out poor prospects.
In contrast to the relatively short duration of the actual accelerator, the time spent in talent selection is substantial. According to Nesta, it’s common practice for accelerators to use selection committees composed of strategic partners, investors, alumni, and experts or mentors. Applicant interviews with these committees can range from a short, informal chat to an hour-long inquisition.
A graphic from Startupbootcamp shows their funnel-shaped selection process at the end of which only three percent of applicants are accepted.

Nesta’s “Startup Accelerator Programmes: A Practice Guide” includes examples of accelerator selection processes from Techstars London, Fintech Innovation Lab, and Bethnal Green Ventures. While all three use online applications, their methods diverge after that. Techstars and Bethnal Green end the process with a face-to-face committee interview, whereas Fintech puts shortlisted candidates through a half-day boot camp during which they trial-run their pitch. In between, all three have expert and/or executive review teams that create a shortlist.
Selection Criteria
Here arethree questions to consider when designing a startup selection process.
What key criteria would you look for in your startups?
How will you structure your selection process to ensure you find the right startups?
Which other stakeholders could you engage in the selection process?
The Deloitte report, “Design Principles for Building a Successful Corporate Accelerator,” lists questions to ask in the selection process tailored to two different models of acceleration: 1) financial returns, in which the accelerator invests in startups and achieves economic benefit through exits, and 2) innovation integration, in which the accelerator directly integrates innovative technologies or disruptive business models into the corporation’s organization.
Questions for financial returns
1. Will the startup integrate or exit within the next five to seven years?
2. Does it have the potential to return 10 times the funds invested?
3. Does the team have a prototype and traction in the market?
4. Is the founding team visionary, ambitious, and able to scale this business?
5. Is the founding team receptive to criticism and ready to pivot from the original idea if the market demands it?
6. Do we have a network of experts that can help this startup in its specific vertical?
Questions for innovation integration
1. Is this a venture representing the edge of our business?
2. Is the marketing moving in such a way that this innovation could become the core of our business?
3. Do we have the specific resources the startup needs to develop the technology?
4. Do we have a network of experts in this vertical?
5. Is the founding team visionary, ambitious, and able to scale this business beyond borders?
6. Is the founding team receptive to criticism and ready to pivot from the original idea if the market demands it?

Additional resources for accelerator applicants
A post by Paul Graham that gives insight into how Y Combinator partners choose cohort members.
A 2012 collection of questions commonly used in Y Combinator interviews.
Assessing the Founders
Paul Graham and Sam Altman have devised a way of gauging applicants’ potential for success. The method asks applicants to describe a time when they’d hacked something to their advantage or “beaten the system” in some way. This question can reveal initiative, creativity, tenacity, and the ability to think strategically to solve a problem.
Intelligence is not the number one criterion that Y Combinator looks for in applicants. According to Graham, “That’s the myth in the Valley … as long as you’re over a certain threshold of intelligence, what matters most is determination.” Altman lists the following characteristics that he looks for when selecting startups: clarity of vision, clarity of explanation, determination, passion, and evidence that applicants have done something great in the past. Moreover, Altman spends only 10 minutes identifying these characteristics in an applicant.
How do you assess a whole team using these criteria? Graham looks closely at not just how well startup teams work together but also how they get along. The relationship between the founders has to be strong. According to Graham, “Startups do to the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock: if it can be pulled apart, it will be.”
8: Select Mentors for Your Startup
Selecting the right applicants is only half the story when it comes to building a corporate accelerator. Top accelerators thrive at the intersection of promising startups and thoughtful mentors. These two groups act as the fuel to create invaluable networks and interactions that lead to a successful and enduring accelerator.
Mentorship is ubiquitous among corporate accelerators, and it works. At their best, mentors can provide startups with advice and access to networks and funding. Having top-performing entrepreneurs as mentors gives a startup an advantage.
Expand
Moreover, there’s evidence from GALI that multiple mentors are desirable. More mentors help startups separate ideas shared by successful entrepreneurs from thoughts that may be rooted in personal eccentricities. In fact, parsing the advice and input from mentors within a restricted timeframe and making decisions is one of the most complex and demanding tasks that accelerator teams will face.
Susan L. Cohen noted that involving more mentors can result in conflicting advice but consulting with multiple mentors within a short period can help founders identify commonalities in the conflicting feedback.
Brad Feld noted that information management is a vital part of the learning process. According to Feld, “If you don’t build your own muscle around collecting, synthesizing, dealing with, and deciding what to do with all the data that is coming at you, then you are going to have massive problems as your company scales up.”
Cohen suggests that accelerators schedule meetings for founders, which gives the founders a wider pool of mentors. It’s also likely to result in a more diverse set of mentors than the startups are likely to assemble themselves.
Predictably, not all experts see mentor overload as a good thing. Fred Wilson, an investor, believes that too much mentor feedback creates confusion, wastes time and energy, and even results in loss of confidence. Also, the quality of mentors is bound to have an effect.
Rhett Morris is the director of Endeavor Insight, the analytics and research arm of Endeavor Global. His take is that mentors who had already achieved success in the tech industry were able to help younger tech startups outperform their peers by a factor of three. The benefits from lower quality mentors were much lower. Ravi Belani of Alchemist Accelerator went a bit further at the 2015 Wolves Summit in Poland saying that a subpar mentor can actually do harm to a startup by consuming valuable time.
So where do mentors come from, and how do you separate the wheat from the chaff? Here’s how to select the right mentor.
One method of mentor recruitment is more of a matchmaking process between startups and mentors. In a 2011 report, “Nurturing Innovation: Venture Acceleration Networks,” the World Bank suggests that mentors and entrepreneurs select each other. The idea is that the relationship becomes sticky and long-lasting for a period beyond the scope of the accelerator, creating a stronger entrepreneurship network.
The World Bank report also reviewed the methods used by leading accelerators for mentorship recruitment. Here are some of the methods.
MIT’s Venture Mentorship Service: Mentor recruitment is based on referrals. MIT VMS mentors said their main motivations to join were the following:
Exposure to interesting MIT start-ups
The opportunity to educate younger generations
Connecting with talented people as peer mentors
Techstars: The selection process at this accelerator is informal and based on referrals. The managing directors typically know the mentor candidate directly, or they’re referred to them by a trusted source in their social network. Beyond that, the typical recruitment process is described as follows:
A short discussion with the mentor and due diligence.
Mentors are selected for their extensive entrepreneurial experience. Academic credentials do not play an important role in the selection of mentors.
Mentors looking to develop relationships with companies in view of selling their services are not accepted.
Mentors are attracted by the high quality of the Techstars startups and of some of the other mentors serving in the program.
Once a company has identified suitable mentors, how is their knowledge best applied? According to venture capitalist and mentor Christopher Quek, there are three areas where mentors are most valuable.
As domain specialists, such as mentors with experience in specific areas such as finance, education, energy, or health (for digital health technology).
As skill specialists, for example, mentors who can teach and coach in specific skills such as UI/UX, sales, legal, business, or design.
As connectors or networkers, for example, mentors who are willing to expand and share their network.
An interesting insight from the GALI study is that accelerator program alumni may not be the best mentors. Moreover, including potential customers as mentors is a good idea, which makes sense given that the consumer is the ultimate judge of any concept or innovation.
External Resources: Corporate Accelerator Mentorship 
Recruiting qualified people is only a part of creating a solid mentorship program. Even the highest quality candidates need to be trained in mentorship best practices. The following resources provide insight into successful mentorship models, with a focus on mentoring startups:
The Mentor Manifesto: The original “Mentor Manifesto,” created by David Cohen with the help of Jon Bradford and Brad Feld, outlines a set of principles supported by years of accelerator work and thousands of mentor interactions.
Deconstructing the Mentor Manifesto: Brad Feld goes in depth through each component of the manifesto. This series is broken up into 18 promised posts, 16 of which are live.
MIT’s Venture Mentoring Service: MIT has created a unique model to coach early stage startups. The VMS has trained over 66 organizations from 18 countries on its mentorship model.
Establishing a Powerful Mentorship Program: Louis Goldish provides an overview of some of the most important characteristics of the VMS model.
Nurturing Innovation: Venture Acceleration Networks: The World Bank and Russian Venture Company present a review of venture acceleration models.
How to Build a Successful Mentoring Program: This guide lays out an approach for building mentoring programs within companies.
How to Maximize the Value of Mentors in Accelerators: Ben Yoskovitz.
Finally, any program needs to be monitored and assessed. The quality of mentorship can be assessed through feedback surveys that the startups complete. This information is part of a feedback loop that allows for constant improvement in the mentorship process.
9. Manage Your Corporate Accelerator
Who “owns” the corporate accelerator? What risks are associated with this tool? What is the timeline for a return on investment?
Independent accelerators typically answer to contributing investors, whereas corporate accelerators answer to the C-Suite, the board of directors, and shareholders. Budget considerations, annual reports, and risk management add a complex layer to accelerator design and management.
Conflicts abound in the governance realm. For example, a typical corporation makes decisions based on an annual schedule, which means, according a CB Insights interview with Dave McClure, that startups live and die within that timeframe. While corporations’ quarterly and annual reports exemplify consistency, startups live in a boom or bust world.
The hope is, of course, that an accelerator is successful, but determining the impact of an accelerator is complex considering the variable ROI expectations of the corporation versus the accelerator.
Leadership and shareholders need to be aware that corporate accelerators rarely lead to instant results, and communication about innovation efforts with longer timelines must be clear. One of the worst possible outcomes for an accelerator is a premature termination.
There are several models that address the time required for a measurable impact on a company’s core business. In McKinsey’s Three Horizons of Growth model, corporate accelerators exist around Horizon 3, shown in the illustration, with a timeframe for contribution to growth of approximately five to 12 years.

Managing C-Suite Expectations
“When it comes to building the corporate accelerator, the organization should understand that the process requires time and continuous learning concerning what works best for the organization as well as the startups.”
— Design Principles for Building a Successful Corporate Accelerator, Deloitte, 2015
Communication about innovation efforts with longer timelines has to be clear. Leadership and shareholders need to be aware that corporate accelerators rarely lead to instant results. One of the worst possible outcomes for an accelerator is a premature termination.
“Corporate sponsors of incubators and accelerators bring greater resources to bear, but their commitment to acceleration may change at any time due to factors outside the influence of the program,” wrote the authors of California Tool Works, a report on innovation and acceleration by the California Business Incubation Alliance. “This kind of change often interrupts the operation of accelerators and their associated networks.”
At the CB Insights’ Innovation Summit in January 2017, Los Angeles Times tech reporter Paresh Dave asked 500 Startups founding partner Dave McClure about corporate timelines for accelerators:
Paresh Dave: So, what’s wrong about looking at the five-year horizon and doing that?
Dave McClure: I don’t think most corporates plan for that long. Certainly, most people running corporate accelerator programs, if you look at the trajectory on those, they often aren’t renewed for more than one or two years.
“Building an accelerator is an exercise in ‘business building’ in itself, and is in fact the first step towards an internal ‘business building’ unit for the corporation,” Deloitte wrote in Design Principles for Building a Successful Corporate Accelerator. “This is a concept which we believe will be standard in successful major corporations within the next five years.”
In order for the concept to work, Deloitte wrote, the organization has to understand the mechanisms of early-stage venturing, and that it usually takes five to seven years for early-stage ventures to achieve meaningful financial results. Even a startup that doubles that speed is looking at a two- to four-year timeline.
“This type of accelerator requires a strong long-term financial commitment with lasting C-level and board support, anticipating that the accelerator will most likely be a cost center before achieving returns,” the report noted. “Chances are high that along the way, a significant number of startups will fold or fail to achieve acceptable results.”
Justifying Corporate Accelerator Costs
“A rule of thumb for the financial estimation is to set aside 5-10 percent of the money that the organization would like to see a business create. For example, if the goal is to build a 100 million-euro business, the organization should be looking to set aside 5 million-10 million euros for building and running the accelerator.” 
— Design Principles for Building a Successful Corporate Accelerator, Deloitte, 2015
Expenses for a corporate accelerator may include third-party vendors, office space, marketing expenses and internal teams, according to Falguni Desai, managing director of Future Asia Ventures, writing in Forbes. “Budgets to simply run the accelerator can range anywhere from $2 million to $5 million per year,” he wrote. Outsourcing your accelerator to a company like Techstars costs an upwards of $1 million, according to a discussion on Quora.
But comparing R&D spending to accelerator expenses adds perspective.

The 2016 Global Innovation 1000 study by PwC Strategy shows that the 10 most innovative companies outperformed the top 10 R&D spenders, which refutes traditional theory and past research studies.
No one will be surprised to hear that Apple and Alphabet continue to lead the most innovative list, followed by 3M and Tesla. However, they do so with far less spending on R&D than some big-name industry leaders. Volkswagen, Samson Electronics, and Amazon spent the most on R&D but with little to show for it. Apple spent $8.1 billion on R&D and outperformed Volkswagen in innovation, which spent a colossal $13.2 billion. 3M spent just $1.8 billion on R&D and outperformed Samsung, which spent close to $13 billion.
Depending on strategic motives and company structure, accelerators and corporate venturing could well be a way to save money and complement R&D programs.
According to Yael Hochberg, a visiting professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, startups are about experimentation, and the cost of that experimentation is about one-tenth what it was a decade ago. Hochberg says, “[Businesses] can actually go out and get a sense of whether these things are going to be successful a lot more quickly and at a much lower cost.”
Corporate Accelerator Leadership and Structure
Building a corporate accelerator into an established business requires surgical precision. Proper leadership needs to be in place in order to manage expectations and ensure that both corporation and accelerator are getting what they need.
An accelerator is straddling the line between an emerging concept and a contribution to a mature and established corporation. There is a need, therefore, for an entrepreneurial mindset that also has a deep understanding of the company’s culture, structure, and mission.
Dominik K. Kanbach and Stephan Stubner suggest combining parent-company heads of corporations with over 15 years’ experience, leaders with startup experience, and a network of relevant external stakeholders such as investors. Deloitte recommends some areas that accelerator leaders should consider at the outset. These include identifying areas for potential disruption in the industry, determining whether there is a long-term commitment to building exponential business and scaling, and ensuring that the corporate leaders are supportive of digital transformation.
The hardest part of securing the long-term support of the C-Suite and board is persuading them that the risk of not following an innovative path and allocating the required resources is greater than the risk of doing so.
What’s scary about a corporate accelerator is that the risks are admittedly high. There are significant initial costs, and there is no immediate payoff. The quality of both startups and mentors can be low if either are poorly selected. Based on this graphic from the World Bank, few corporate boards that are protective of shareholders would jump at the chance to initiate an accelerator based on the risks.
Image Source: World Bank
Expand
But that’s the state of technology advancement in the digital age. High speed and high risk.
Kanbach and Stubner describe corporate accelerators as either integrated within the parent company as part of a specific business unit, such as digital or online business, or a specific department, such as innovation management, corporate strategy, or product development. The way that the accelerator is integrated determines the reporting line of the accelerator management team.
A separate accelerator removes the direct risk from the corporate coffers. It can act as a bridge between innovation and the corporation. It’s funding should be separate and anticipate high initial startup costs with a suitable timeline for returns. David McClure of 500 Startups warns, however, that too much accelerator independence could be detrimental if a company has many innovative activities ongoing within its structure. While some projects might have a short horizon and some a longer horizon, innovation efforts should be coordinated to avoid crossovers, expense, and missed synergies.
According to McClure, “[the corporation] might have an accelerator program, they might have an innovation program, they might have a direct investment program, they might have a VC arm and they might have acquisition, right? And I think all those should probably be coordinated.” That’s because innovation doesn’t start and end with the creation of a new product; a new product becomes part of the corporation’s core business.
Corporate Accelerator Metrics and KPIs
Pertinent to the independence and success of an accelerator, we look at how an accelerator’s progress can be measured over the short and long term. Data are key. Data can be the difference between the continued support of corporate leadership and the cessation of an accelerator. Data are also essential for cohort members to assess and document their progress in meaningful ways.
A study by the California Business Incubation Alliance from 2016 found that only 4 percent of corporate programs don’t track any performance metrics of their portfolio companies but almost 90 percent track financial and product milestones. Which data are tracked and reported depends on the focus of the accelerator governance.
Financial: A focus on the financials is most likely to be demanded by the board and shareholders; therefore, Deloitte lists follow-on funding, the total value of portfolio companies, and the number of startups that have survived, exited, or folded (over each year or every three) as key performance indicators.
Innovation Integration: For companies with a strategic focus on innovation integration, the number of joint efforts (co-development, partnering), the number of integrated technology or business models, business unit impact, additional business or revenue from startup, or number of startups that survived, exited, or folded can be used as KPIs.
Public Relations: For marketing, the number of PR events, the amount of press coverage, the number of applications, and the number of participants can all show an uptick in ROI as a result of the accelerator.
It’s important for corporations to be transparent with their accelerator metrics to maintain trust and credibility and to ensure future high-quality applicants. Techstars provides an excellent example of transparency by listing every company it has ever funded.
For ideas on additional metrics for assessing startups, McClure suggests the following data for early-stage startups.
Funding: Dollar amount or number of startups that raised capital after going through an accelerator program (or number that raised over a certain amount, for example, $250,000 to $500,000).
Product: The change in functional milestones for minimum viable product (or improvement in selected features as measured by observed usage/qualitative survey/net promoter score).
UX/Usage: The change in user reaction to a product measured by time on site, retention over time, a key conversion metric, or target goal behavior.
Markets: The change in the number of active or registered users, or percentage conversion for a set of acquisition channels or campaigns.
Revenue: The change in money generated, ideally based on the cost to acquire users.
Team/hires: The change in team experience/skills acquired or hired during acceleration.
Founder satisfaction: Simple qualitative survey of founder satisfaction with the program.
10. Post-accelerator: Assess Your Success
Post-program is the time to take stock and tweak the corporate accelerator process. While their role is to increase the rate and quality of learning over a short period, their true value comes from the long-term growth of relationships and networks. Here’s howto optimize these factors after the program ends.
The Importance of Post-program Startup Support
“Once an accelerator has developed over a number of years, the alumni network can be an important source for mentors and investors, as successful graduates are more likely to invest back into the community that supported them in the first place.”
— A Look Inside Accelerators, Bart Clarysse, Mike Wright and Jonas Van Hove, February 2015
Peter Relan, internet executive and creator of an early startup incubator, claims that 90 percent of accelerators and incubators will fail, or won’t provide a positive income, based on the rule of thumb that nine out of 10 startups fail. He lists the reasons for failure as too little mentorship, a lack of funding post-program, and a lack of development resources. All of this can be solved with post-program support.
The Power of Networks
Accelerators require long-term management. They improve over time, and their popularity depends on the quality of the selected applicants and mentors. The graduates from an accelerator join an alumni network, which broadens the accelerator and the corporation’s connections. Each new startup member through the program is a future alumnus who is often willing to re-invest time and money in the organization.
One suggestion from participants was that an online platform where program alumni can connect, share experiences, and access mentors they had met during the program would be helpful. In addition, graduates would like to have additional live training or online resources as a component of continued support services.
An ongoing network of alumni extends collaboration, increases knowledge-sharing and ensures the long term success of accelerators. Y Combinator’s unmatched success in this space is largely due to its extensive alumni network. There are even VC funds made up solely of Y Combinator alumni (Pioneer Fund, Orange Fund).
The infographic below shows how such networks play out in real life for Y Combinator.

Support Programs
Relan implies that incubators are often more for show and PR purposes than they are real efforts with a long-term commitment to advancement. He also concludes that those startups who continue to have access to resources and support after they exit will have the best chance at survival.
From the startups’ perspective, according to an analysis by the I-DEV International in conjunction with the Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs (ANDE) and Agora Partnerships, a common complaint of incubator and accelerator alumni and a possible reason for failure is that programs did not provide enough support once the formal program came to an end. Some participants reported that they struggled to access the resources or ongoing support to translate plans into action.
The best accelerators provide outreach events and regular interactions for their alumni. According to Bridging the “Pioneer Gap”, the types of post-program support offered to entrepreneurs include:
Public-relations opportunities.
Connections with investors.
Board participation.
HR/recruitment support.
Regional meetups.
Online communities listing funding and promotion opportunities.
Office space.
Further, these accelerators provide outreach to their alumni, in the form of events and regular interactions, to keep startups engaged with their program. This further strengthens the network effects outlined above.
“A demo day for alumni prior to the public pitches provides opportunities for the startups to get constructive feedback and engage the accelerator community,” wrote Thomas Kohler in a Harvard Business Review case study.
Founder Feedback
As with any project, there needs to be a review, and founder and mentor feedback is the bread and butter of any program that wants to achieve continuous improvement. In the case of Y Combinator, a survey is sent out to graduate companies requesting anonymous feedback. The information received is crucial to improving the results of subsequent projects, as stressed by Y Combinator’s Michael Siebel:
“One of the things we do is send a survey out to every company asking for anonymous feedback. You have no idea how much we read that. … That’s kind of the base for how Y Combinator changes. The things that founders think we need to improve are the things we figure out how to improve for the next batch.”
— Michael Siebel
Investing in Startups
After the accelerator program comes to an end, corporations may want to increase their involvement with promising firms. According to Kohler’s case study, there are five main ways a corporation can do that.
Corporation supports pilot project: This is a faster, cheaper way to develop innovative solutions or products than trying to do so internally. It’s also likely to involve fewer risks for the core business. “Corporations may develop new products together with startups, explore market opportunities through startups, or solve business challenges via startups’ technology or talent,” Kohler wrote.
Corporation becomes startup customer: As we’ve seen, the relationship that is built in the course of an accelerator program gives the startup an opportunity to land the corporate sponsor as an early customer. At the same time, interaction with multiple startups in its accelerator gives a corporation an opportunity to learn about different solutions to their business challenges. “Mutual benefits result if the startup wins the company as a high-profile customer, and the corporation finds a solution to its pain points,” Kohler wrote. “Working with a large corporation can be an important step for startups to test their product-market fit and scale their operations.”
Corporation becomes distribution partner: A startup that can offer its products through its corporate accelerator sponsor can avoid the cost and effort of building out its own distribution network. Such channel partnerships can be mutually beneficial if they also solve a problem or create a new market for the corporation.
Corporation invests in startup: For both parties, this can be a better deal than they’d be able to make separately. “Backing and supporting startups is beneficial for corporations as this provides them — at lower capital requirement and higher speed compared to internal R&D — with access to new markets and capabilities,” Kohler wrote. “At the same time, startups benefit from favorable terms relative to traditional sources of venture capital.”
Corporation acquires startup: “Acquiring startups is a quick and impactful way to solve specific business problems and enter new markets,” wrote the authors of the 2001 Journal of Management paper “Resource complementarity in business combinations.” Accelerators allow a corporation to explore a variety of startups that could be acquisition targets, saving time that otherwise would have been devoted to scouting in the open market. Kohler noted that for startups, acquisition is an appealing exit strategy.",12662

A Brief History of Incubators
The very first incubator hatched from an egg.
Amidst a robust poultry industry in the 1960s, the Rochester-based Mount Hope Hatchery was trying to meet the growing demand for poultry and was in need of 80,000 square feet to house surplus chickens. That led them to the Batavia Industrial Center close to Rochester, New York.
The Mancuso family, well-known and respected local business owners, had bought a defunct old farm machinery plant and its warehouse in Batavia, which had closed leaving thousands of local residents out of work. The family wanted to use the warehouse in some way, to help boost the local economy ideally, and planned to find tenants to lease the space. Mount Hope Hatchery’s chicken coops were some of the early businesses tenants in the space.
The idea was straightforward: lease out excess commercial space to growing businesses poorly served by existing markets. No one could foresee that the Mancuso family’s actions would become a model for diversification and innovation. As quoted in an article by Justin Peters in Wired, Mancuso family legend has it that while giving a tour of his complex in 1963, Mancuso said to reporters: “These guys are incubating chickens ….  I guess we’re incubating businesses.”
Far from its humble roots, the incubator concept first seen in Batavia has since transcended regional and national boundaries to become a global phenomenon.

Incubators share some characteristics with corporate accelerators: they interact with startups;  provide physical space; and offer education programs, mentorship, and networks. But the goals and operation of these programs are much different.
Incubators operate over a longer cycle than accelerators. Startups participating in these programs tend to work on more experimental ideas and require more time to develop their product and business model. Because of these traits, the majority of incubators are non-profits, often working with local governments or universities.
This shouldn’t discourage corporates from building this tool. In the same way non-profit incubators succeed in building innovation ecosystems in local communities, corporate incubators strengthen innovation ecosystems inside companies. They also help companies commit to long-term strategy in a world focused on short-term gains.
But long-term strategies are hard to sell to leadership. Understanding the incentives for building incubators will help prospective incubator leaders secure buy-in.
Why Participate in an Incubator?
There is significant risk for companies that invest in incubators (or accelerators). There are upfront costs, and the time horizon for ROI is long. But a long-term commitment to experimentation is essential if companies are to stand a chance. Incubators can house these types of ideas.
Business incubators leverage the unique advantages and perspectives of startups, which established companies often lack. For example, Eddie Yoon and Steve Hughes explain in the Harvard Business Review that startups are better at detecting and unlocking emerging and latent market demand perhaps because they are consistently monitoring the pulse of a specific market area. Where startups often stumble, however, is when it comes to scaling their concept.
Big companies often make the mistake of creating what they can rather than what people want. They lack the agility and creativity of early-stage startups, but these big companies are more experienced at scaling. They also have advantages in logistics, such as procurement, distribution, and manufacturing, and established sales and marketing advantages.
The two entities complement each other; they can perfect a product and hold off on the scaling until the market is ready.
Large companies can benefit from and support startups’ capability to provide proof of concepts through early stage funding and later-stage M&A. But timing is everything. There are plenty of companies looking to invest in a promising startup, but there are far fewer promising startups. Yoon and Hughes explain:
“there are more buyers than sellers; if the first time an established company is made aware of a startup is by receiving a deal book from an investment banker, it’s already too late.”
Companies must stay ahead of the curve and find complimentary startups for partnerships, experimentation and acquisition.
The following list outlines some of the benefits of a corporate incubator for startups and their corporate sponsors.
Benefits for Startups
Possible access to later venture funding
Lower personal and financial risk
Ready-to-use infrastructure such as office space, IT tools, and administrative business support services
Mentorship and training, which can include individual coaching, presentation, and negotiation skills
Assistance with business management, technology, and legal services
The opportunity to build relationships with potential investors, suppliers, and industry experts
If a startup is sponsored by a host company, it will likely receive funding, skills, expertise, peer support, and R&D knowledge from the host

Criticisms of the Business Incubator Concept
The results of business incubators can be hard to quantify. Ernesto Tavoletti notes that in incubators “tend to fail” in supporting entrepreneurship, innovation, and regional development and are not proven policy instruments despite their popularity and the funding and promotion they receive.
Tavoletti also notes that studies that claim that incubators create jobs often originate from incubator associations and only measure the intended effects, not the unintended effects. These studies often fail to consider that firms would most likely have received funding without participating in an incubator. In some cases, studies include companies that moved into incubators later in their development to take advantage of facilities or funding.
On the other hand, a 2017 study finds that firm performance is greatly enhanced by an incubator. This study by Ayatse, Kwahar, and Iyortsuun, published in the Journal of Global Entrepreneurship Research finds that revenue growth, job creation, venture funding, networking, and alliance building all improved after the incubation process. Interestingly, the study also finds that tenants should not overstay their time in an incubation program because that could reduce their chances of survival once they graduate.
The truth here is that every incubator is different. Each requires strategic planning from people who both know the tool and know the organization. It’s important to understand the theories behind incubators, the various models, the different tenant profiles, and to hear the perspectives of incubator critics.
The Underlying Theories in Support of Incubators
In a 2012 white paper, Mathew J. Manimala and Devi Vijay of the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore presented seven theories that explain and conceptualize incubator functions.
Structural Support Theory
The structural support theory proposes that new ventures can overcome the problems associated with startups, such as being new and small, if the cost of their infrastructure and overheads can be reduced. According to this theory, “pooling resources, as occurs in an incubator context, leads to efficiencies because the central pooling of resources can significantly reduce overhead costs and thereby increase operating efficiencies.”
Structural support can include office space, communication technology, managerial assistance, access to laboratory and equipment, research facilities, and expert staff. According to this theory, the venture stands a better chance of survival if support in these areas is pooled.
Cluster Theory
The cluster theory was developed by Michael E. Porter and described in The Harvard Business Review in 1998. The theory places incubators within a broader ecosystem with other entities. Clusters are “geographic concentrations of interconnected companies and institutions in a particular field.”
The clusters are composed of industries and other linked entities important to competition. Fundamentally, they are networks and include, for example, component providers, machinery providers, services suppliers, and providers of specialized infrastructure. The advantage of being part of an incubator within a cluster is that it is easier to access resources within this environment, which increases efficiency and productivity.
According to Manimala and Vijay, the cluster theory builds on structural support theory and suggests that high-tech firms with similar characteristics in the same value chain cluster stimulate faster knowledge dissemination and synergistic growth using each other’s capabilities.
Social Network Theory
This theory posits that the effect of internal and external network connections and social networks increase the client firm’s network density and positively affect the development and growth of the startups.
“[S]ocial networks and contacts,” according to Manimala and Vijay, “facilitate access to capital, credibility and respectability because of the association with the incubator and its sponsor institutions, and they provide techno-managerial assistance through the incubator’s professionals and/or network.”
New Venture Creation Theory
With the new venture creation theory, network access and community support for entrepreneurs increases their legitimacy and the chances of venture funding and survival.
A 2004 study by Neck, Meyer, Corben, and Corbett found that incubator organizations, spin-offs, informal and formal networks, physical infrastructure, and the culture of the region where the incubator is located interact to form an ecosystem conducive to high-technology entrepreneurial activity. Additionally, the authors found greater rates of new venture formation were found following critical moments in the life of incubator organizations.
The Resource-based View
This theory states that incubators provide both tangible and intangible resources to client firms. These resources—knowledge sources in the form of universities, for example—and market proximity spur growth through a community effect. This is not unlike the cluster theory in that incubators benefit from proximity and access to networks and logistics.
Gassmen and Becker used two levels of analysis in 2006—the resource flow between the corporate incubator and the technology venture and the resource flow interface between the corporate incubator and the technology venture—to develop a model that can determine “how corporate incubators function as specialized corporate units that hatch new businesses.” They emphasize that tangible resources are all visible and easy to measure, whereas intangible resources, such as tacit knowledge and branding, are more difficult to quantify and assess.
Dyadic Theory
The concept behind this theory is that entrepreneurs “operate in an inter-dependent co-production dyad” where business assistance is provided by the sponsor. According to Hackett and Dilts (2004), incubation co-production stimulates developmental assistance in independent incubator-client dyads.
This co-development is of mutual benefit and increases the likelihood that startups survive and that the sponsor and regional economies benefit.
Real Options Theory
Real options theory borrows concepts from the finance literature. The theory states that the selection of startups or entrepreneurs for the incubator creates an option, and the injection of required resources, monitoring, and assistance are also options. The real options methodology was initially applied when evaluating technological assets such as R&D.
In 2004, Hackett and Dilts used real options theory to predict whether new ventures will survive the early stages of development. The incubator is conceptualized as an entrepreneurial firm that sources and manages the innovation process within emerging organizations. The incubator is the unit of analysis while incubation outcomes, measured in terms of startup growth and financial performance at the time of incubator exit, provide indicators of success.
Theory is one thing, but the best way to learn is by doing. The following outlines the steps to building an incubator.
How to Build an Incubator
Step 1. Select the Incubator Model
“For incubators to live up to their full economic potential, they need to overcome two pitfalls: they need to provide real value, not just office space, and they need to measure success in more than just outside funding.”
— Harvard Business Review, 2013
Internal corporate incubators
Internal corporate incubators are the most common type of incubator. They are built inside the corporation, often without walls, and the startups are often spun out when they graduate. These incubators increase the chances of intrapreneurial success, and the corporation often receives equity ownership as though they were founders of the startups.
Entrepreneurs are typically recruited to manage the startup, and internal employees may join the new company. However, not all incubated concepts are spun out, and companies use these incubators to create breakthrough products for growth and revenue. PwC states that while typical R&D seeks incremental development, incubators build company initiatives that have market viability. Incubators strive to go from concept to market.
Internal corporate incubators nearly always focus on the sectors relevant to the parent company. TechCrunch lists the following examples of successful corporate incubation programs and startup spin-outs:
McDonalds’s spin out of Red Box (acquired by Coinstar for over $150 million)
Google’s spin out of Niantic Labs and Pokémon GO (reportedly worth $3.5 billion)
Oracle Labs’ development of the Java programming language
Amazon’s Lab 126 creation of the Kindle, Echo, and Fire products
External corporate incubators
External corporate incubators provide external entrepreneurs and startups with a location, infrastructure, and resources to pursue potential ideas. Host organizations seek out startups that they believe have potential in their business area in the hopes of later financial gain and an ongoing relationship, if not an ongoing investment.
This is based on the idea of “open innovation. Originally coined by Henry Chesbrough, open innovation is the concept that companies must open themselves up to the external world for the creation and development of new products and ideas. The following table from Henry Chesbrough’s writing in MIT’s Sloan Review compares open innovation to closed innovation:
Fig 1.1

Here are some examples of open innovation provided by ideXlab:
Audi launched the Audi Innovation Award, a contest where participants submit their concepts for the car of the future. The winner earns a $25,000 worth of consultancy.
Procter & Gamble published a list of technical problems that their team failed to solve on the company website. Readers were asked to provide a workable solution, no matter how out-of-the-box it may have seemed.
GE launched Ecomagination Challenge, which requests ideas from anyone who has ideas related to energy problems.
Hewlett Packard created open innovation laboratories where researchers worldwide collaborate and create partnerships between internal teams and external scientists.
Local Motors is a crowdsourcing startup created in 2007 by Jay Rogers, a former Marine. The model avoids the typical financial cost and time involved in designing and creating a new car because participants provide the industrial design. The winners of the design contests can also receive royalties from the car sales.
Incubators can provide the infrastructure for cooperation with the external ecosystem. The cooperation between the two entities can vary in its intensity. However, the goal is always to partner, learn, and build a successful new business that can be scaled independently either as a joint commercial venture or integrated into the host corporation.
Among external and internal incubators, there are various models and types. The U.S. Department of Commerce separates them into incubators “with walls” and “without walls.” Incubators with walls provide a separate space and location for projects, and incubators without walls (or “virtual incubators”) house the incubator within the corporate environment and use the existing infrastructure and communication systems.
Evangelos Simoudis, founder of Synapse Partners, describes the following four incubator models in his piece “Using Corporate Incubators and Accelerators To Drive Disruptive Innovation.” I suggest that a corporation should adapt these models to their needs. 
The Incubator/Accelerator Model
This model includes both intrapreneurs (entrepreneurs within a corporation) and entrepreneurs. The incubation period for this type of model is typically between four to 18 months. Teams, if deemed of a high standard, are invited to join the corporation, or to “spin in.” Such teams are retained for longer with additional sponsor investment to keep them going, or they are required to work outside the corporation, as a “spin out,” with an investment from either the sponsor’s VCs or perhaps in conjunction with external VCs. Alternatively, the teams can be left to raise their own funding from external VCs or other funding sources.
This model is appropriate when a sponsoring business wants access to early stage concepts, is looking at the long term—ideally, seven to 10 years—for concept development and potential disruption, has appropriate metrics set up to measure the startup’s performance, and is open to the risks involved in mentoring and supporting an early-stage startup.
The unique benefits of this model are that there is a long-term commitment to disruption, which is crucial. Concepts need time to morph into products, time to reach the market, and time for adoption, which means that there may be some delay before there is significant ROI. Another benefit is that entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs work side-by-side and may eventually join the sponsor’s business units.
But entrepreneurs should be aware of the downsides to the model. According to Wharton Magazine, the sheer number of incubators is increasing, and not all of them are up to snuff. Some have weak investor relationships, which means that fundraising for the startups might be difficult come demo day. In addition, new programs have not had sufficient time to build a reputation or track record, which is not conducive to ready investor funding in a competitive startup market.
Wharton magazine also suggests that the time that entrepreneurs must spend at social events, building networks and discussing initiatives with potential investors, is time taken away from engineering, experimenting, and problem-solving toward a better end product.
Samsung and Telefonica are examples of firms that have applied this model.
The Pay-it-forward Model
For this model, the corporate incubator provides facilities and training while the teams work with external entrepreneurial teams. The idea is to expose teams to real-world problems in the industry and to provide resources and experts to help them solve those problems. This type of program typically lasts from six to 12 months, and the sponsoring corporation receives no equity from the startup.
This model is appropriate when the corporation wants to expose its executives to startup thinking and practices, attract entrepreneurial talent, and access new ideas and early-stage concepts from other resources to solve existing problems.
The unique benefits to corporations for this type of incubator are access to startup teams and their thinking and the creation of goodwill. A downside to this model that entrepreneurs might want to consider is that there may be a significant bias toward the interests of the corporation.
Allianz and Turner have applied this model.
The Developing Intrapreneurs Model
LinkedIn, Google, and Starbucks use this model where entrepreneurial teams incubate solutions and test business models within the organization; hence the term “intrapreneur.” This strategy works for companies that can’t pursue ideas using existing business units, so they set up a separate unit. This model fits when an organization is strongly committed to long-term concept building to achieve disruption.
The unique benefits of this model are that new products and business models can be rapidly developed. Resources are allocated to strengthen intrapreneurship and permit risk taking with out-of-the-box thinking.
One downside, according to Sean Silverthorne of Harvard Business School, is that if a startup is working on a product or service that competes in some way with the business of the company, the effort could be perceived as a threat to many inside the company.
The New Work Environments Testing Model
This model, applied by ATT Foundry and Standard Chartered Bank (SC Studio), describes creative work and the testing of new solutions or environments by the innovators.
The new work environments testing model is an incubator without walls. The sponsoring corporation does not offer on-site space for clients although they may have a central office through which to coordinate services, house the management staff, meet with clients, and perhaps even conference rooms. This is a suitable model for a corporation that wants to test startups but does not want to assume the risk of creating an external startup team.
The unique benefits to the new work environments testing model are that the corporation can use existing structures, such as flat management and open communication tools, to experiment with ideas, which reduces costs and may lead to better performance within the organization.
The New Incubator – Soft Landing for International Programs
Although a goal of incubators has been to boost local economies and ideally the national market, not all are focused on domestic markets. Many startups now use the incubator environment to reach beyond domestic boundaries.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, international business incubators provide the same set of entrepreneurial services as a typical incubator, but they also provide a “soft landing” for international firms seeking to enter the U.S. market.
These types of incubators often provide specialized services. For example, the University of Florida’s soft landing program helps both domestic and international firms integrate into the Central Florida business community. The program helps with short-term leased office space, networking with the Central Florida business community, domestic market research, and provides access to experts on legal, government, regulatory, and press and media matters.
The University of Toronto has partnered with the Chinese firm Diantou.net to help companies who are entering the lucrative Chinese market. According to The Impact Centre at the University of Toronto center, Diantou.net will “provide start-ups with legal, marketing and other support services” while the Toronto center will offer entrepreneurship courses to Chinese students, researchers, and startups.
Other similar incubators offer translation services, language training, assistance with documentation such as obtaining business and driver’s licenses, cultural training, assistance with visa and immigration, and housing assistance.
Consider these examples and design a model that best suits your organization and its goals.
Step 2. Select Your Industry Focus
Most incubators are focused on a specific industry such as digital education, green technology, homeland security, fashion, or food. An industry focus ensures that the available skills and resources are optimized and targeted.
Technology incubators are specifically focused on emerging technologies such as software, biotechnology, robotics, or instrumentation. A service incubation program, as the name implies, focuses on entrepreneurial firms in the service sector, for example, landscapers, graphic designers, accountants, and internet-based companies. However, mixed-use incubators, or general-purpose incubators, nurture the growth of all types of companies and may not fit into any specialized niche.
According to Nola Hewitt-Dundas, incubators are increasingly oriented toward knowledge-intensive activities such as knowledge dispersion among collaborating actors and a more open collaborative model. While customers and suppliers have traditionally been valuable contributors to incubator projects, universities are now also increasingly involved.
Step 3. Select Your Program Length
While corporate accelerators generally stick to a 3-month program, corporate incubators don’t have a strict duration. According to Accion, many incubators require a one- to two-year time commitment that includes incubator training and workshops. At the Polytechnic Institute at New York University, entrepreneur teams typically spend 18 months in the program while other incubators take much longer.
The SPARK Regional Incubator Network in Ann Arbor is structured so that companies graduate from the incubator in two to three years. Clients initially commit to a standard one-year lease. If the business meets their desired milestones, the lease is renewable for one or two additional one-year leases.
The duration of internal incubators depends on how long the company expects the concept to take to see quantifiable value, according to Robert Wolcott of Kellogg Insight. But that’s the tricky part when it comes to early stage concepts. Wolcott explains that a startup may not see any returns for four or five years. Therefore, to retain the commitment of a host corporation, startups must demonstrate some other quantifiable value. Wolcott estimates that this must be achieved within 18 months to keep a corporate board happy.
The reason for this “need to produce” is the budget cycle. According to Wolcott, not much is expected of an incubator startup in the first three or four months. But, after a year, financiers are itching for positive indicators. With no results to speak of after 18 months, a startup might have a target on its back if it doesn’t come up with some proof of positive impacts.
Step 4. Select Your Location
Location considerations are similar to those of corporate accelerators.
Brad Feld, co-founder of Techstars, suggests that business incubators can thrive in any location. His opinion is that because many incubators are “virtual” and lack walls, incubators do not have to be in the same geographic area as the host organization. Rather, it might be better for the incubator to be located where there is optimal access to knowledge and physical resources. Close to a university, for example.
In the case of tech startups, and in the case of Silicon Valley, tech incubators benefit from the networks and events in the local area. According to Michael Seibel of Y Combinator, the Valley offers “money and good valuations. We can introduce them to tons of other companies that can be mentors and customers, and we can introduce them to the pace of the Valley … We can’t do that anywhere else.”
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, graduating entrepreneurs tend to stay in the same geographic region as their incubator organizations and, in most technical industries at least, entrepreneurs usually start businesses related to their previous work. Thus, because most entrepreneurs do not move to start a business, the possibilities for high-technology startups may be limited in some locations.
Where virtual incubators are concerned, they may be able to build a thriving ecosystem of their own, remote from the host organization—particularly if the location provides valuable external networks and resources.

Step 5. Select Your Learning Program
Business incubators and accelerators are fundamentally engines for learning. But the type of learning that you require, as well as the knowledge and skills that each startup team requires, will differ. A diagnostic process can help you to determine how best to allocate resources for learning so that both entities are served.
A model developed by Campbell, Kendrick, and Samuelson shows four basic areas or “services” where incubators contribute – revenue growth, employment or job creation, venture funding, networking, and alliance-building. The value addition activities begin with a diagnosis of needs, which is applied to prospective incubatee’s new business proposals. Once this diagnosis is complete, you can tailor the learning experience for participating startups. For more on learning programs, see our piece in corporate accelerator design.
Step 6. Select Your Tenant
Just as there are different incubator types and models, there are also different types of tenants who may or may not be viable participants in one or more of the incubator models. A lot depends on the support and the resources that you, the host company, are willing or able to provide and whether the startup is in the same industry vertical as the sponsor.
When seeking a tenant, consider their maturity and readiness. Ernesto Tavoletti describes four types of incubator tenants.
Anchor tenants are typically mature entrepreneurs and can contribute financially to the incubator. They do not require input from the corporate host. Examples of this type of tenant include accounting companies, law and financial services firms, economic development agencies, or university offices.
Long shots are early-stage startups that require a nurturing environment from the corporate host. These entrepreneurs are aware that they lack resources and require co-production efforts from their host to reach their potential.
Up-and-comers also have significant resource gaps that can be addressed through co-production. These companies are one step ahead of long shots in terms of maturity and are operated by entrepreneurs who are aware of the gaps but are on the verge of being able to engage with resource assistance.
Superstars have matured beyond the up-and-coming stage, and they are ready to engage with minimal co-production efforts from the host. They have resolved problems, can withstand crises, and expect to imminently graduate from the incubator. These companies can act as role models for up-and-comers and long shots.
Step 7. Manage Your Incubator
Given the long-term nature of incubators, they require strategic management. 
The U.S. Department of Commerce found that successful incubators have adopted certain practices such as crafting a written mission statement, selecting clients based on cultural fit, their potential for success, reviewing client needs at the entry stage, showcasing clients to the community and potential funders, and charging for rents and service fees.
These factors all stem from successful incubator leadership.
Incubator Leadership
When first creating an incubator, it’s crucial to identify and hire a strong entrepreneurial leader. According to a white paper by the Aspen Institute and National Entrepreneurship Network of India, cost concerns could derail the incubator at the outset if they inhibit hiring someone of the right caliber.
To give some idea of leadership experience, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, on average, incubator managers have 8.1 years of experience in the business incubation industry including 7.5 years at their current position. Over 50 percent of the time of these managers’ is spent delivering client services, building internal and external networks for the program, and facility management.
A study by Monsson and Berg (2016) found that incubation managers had a moderately positive influence on incubators in terms of facilitating access to important actors, assisting with practical advice, and the daily management of the incubator program. According to the authors, the “modest role” played by managers reflects a preoccupation with operational tasks rather than a greater role creating partnerships and synergies.
Financial Commitment and Risk
Incubators and accelerators are a financial commitment. In addition to private funding and investors, public funding of incubators is common.
In Canada, for example, governments provide funding for incubators. However, in Canada,, Sunil Sharma, the chair of the board of the Canadian Acceleration and Business Incubation Association, expressed to The Globe and Mail the concern that there’s already too much government money going to programs that support tech startups.
According to Sharma, “It’s time to really take stock of how much funding has been put into supporting entrepreneurs in Canada and really measure it against the outcomes that we should have been able to show by now.”
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, there is a significant correlation between the size of a business incubation program’s budget and program success; that is, the bigger the budget, the greater the success. However, it is also important to look at revenue sources and how the incubator uses its resources. This research found that receiving a large portion of revenues from client rent and service fees is positively correlated with outcome measures, although the effect is only statistically significant for three client firm outcomes. On the expenditure side, the more programs invest in staffing and program delivery—relative to building maintenance or debt servicing—the higher the probability of improved client firm outcomes.
Incubation program budgets range from revenues of $33,000 with expenses of $17,000 to $2.8 million in revenue with expenses of $2.5 million, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, but data is scarce on this subject. The lack of quantitative data on the value of incubators emphasizes that the risks should be carefully weighed against the potential gains. 
Step 8. Conduct a Post-Program Assessment
The success of incubators and accelerators depends on how the program is managed after startups graduate. Networks and relationships make or break these programs. Successful startups give back to the program, and startups succeed partly because of continued contact from incubator hosts. See our piece on post-program strategies for corporate accelerators for more.
Measuring Incubator Success
“In addition, the business models of many for-profit dot-coms failed to consider that, on average, it takes slightly more than three years to successfully incubate a client firm—and perhaps up to six years or more for that firm to realize significant growth. However, interviews with former managers of dot-com programs suggest that their business plans speculated that clients would begin to turn a profit in 12 to 18 months—or even as few as six months. This flaw in the model most likely contributed to the rapid decline of the dot-com incubator.” 
— US Department of Commerce, 2011
Incubators have similar timeframes with corporate accelerators. While working with startups may imply faster growth, both accelerators and incubators start to create true value after they’ve had time to develop, generally within four to seven years. Incubators, in particular, are harder to quantify during their early stages. Compared to accelerators, the lack of time constraints and PR efforts limit short-term results. (We dive deeper into the time frame for these tools in our article on corporate accelerator management.)
Combine this reality with the risks involved, and it can be difficult to get buy-in from the board. Corporate decisions are based on an annual schedule while, according to Dave McClure of 500 Startups, startups live and die within that period.
To secure buy-in, incubator leaders must think critically to align the implicit benefits of incubators with business goals.
Incubator Metrics and Kpis
The research is mixed when it comes to measuring the success of incubators, much of it claiming that past metrics and performance are either impossible to measure, or the studies suggest using varying metrics. The table below highlights some of the literature findings.

Chaffik Bakkali, Karim Messeghem and Sylvie Sammut, “Pour un outil de mesure et de pilotage de la performance des incubateurs,” 2013 Suggests the balanced-scorecard by Harvard Business School as a measure of incubation success
As evidenced by the past incubator studies, these tools are often studied through a policy lens. This is because the majority of incubators are non-profits. While building local entrepreneurial ecosystems is good for the company in the long term, it’s not the best metric for selling these tools to corporate leadership.
Ayatse, Kwahar, and Iyortsuun’s 2017 review of existing incubator literature found that there is no objective performance measure that can be applied across business incubators. Instead, firms and researchers must make up their own. Metrics identified during their research were the following:
revenues
finance
venture capital funds
graduation from incubation program
firm survival
networking activity
innovative firms
organizational or firm growth
job creation
sales growth
profitability
patents registered
number of patents application
alliance
technology transfer
employment growth
technology growth or development
research and development productivity
ability to share knowledge and technology
high-tech employment.
The above bullet points can give incubator leaders some ideas for KPIs, but it is up to the individual organization to decide how to best serve business goals. For more on balancing business goals with startup engagement programs, see our article on corporate accelerator management.
What Does Success Look Like for Corporate Incubator?
According to EY, studies show that approximately 90 percent of a company’s development efforts never result in commercialized products or services. This could imply that a successful incubator is nothing more than a random incident because there are few defined consistent metrics with which to measure or benchmark incubators.
Bakkali, Messeghem, and Sammut suggest the balanced scorecard, developed by the Harvard Business School, as a particularly useful tool to measure the success of incubators.
The balanced scorecard approach first determines what overall success of the company looks like (ROI, reputation for excellence, growth in market share, etc.) and derives measurable activities that reflect these goals. The activities are categorized by strategic focus, as seen in the diagram below.
Image Source: QuickScore, 2020
Expand
Bakkali, Messeghem, and Sammut (2013) explain that incubator managers insist on risk reduction because they focus excessively on short-term economic indicators. According to the authors, the balanced scorecard is fundamental to the learning process regarding incubator impacts.
What Does Success Look  Like for the Startup?
Incubators are proven to be beneficial for participating startups.  For instance, Eric Harwit, a Fulbright fellow, published a report in 2002 that found that 87 percent of firms that graduated from an incubator were still in business.
Hackett and Dilts (2004) offer more concrete metrics and define the outcome of the incubation process according to five mutually exclusive outcome states that are measured in terms of growth and financial performance at the time of incubatee graduation. These outcome states are the following:
The incubatee is surviving and growing profitably.
The incubatee is surviving and growing and is on a path toward profitability.
The incubatee is surviving but is not growing, not profitable, or is only marginally profitable.
Incubatee operations were terminated while still in the incubator, but losses were minimized.
Incubatee operations were terminated while still in the incubator, and the losses were large.
A white paper by the Aspen Institute and National Entrepreneurship Network of India (2013) provides in-depth information on the problems of measuring incubatee success. The paper discusses exit factors as metrics but emphasizes that what might be a successful exit for one incubator will be different for another. A high-growth technology start-up may consider raising a certain amount of capital as a successful factor for exit, whereas a medium growth start-up may consider positive cash flow and profits a successful factor for exit.
For this metric, the incubator would need to define its successful exit factors based on the type of start-ups that it would incubate. Other suggested exit factors are the following:
During a one to three-year incubation period—customers/user base, capital raised, product launched, valuation, revenue, jobs
At graduation after a one to three-year incubation period—revenue growth, valuations, jobs, total capital raised, social impact
What Does Success Look Like for Non-profit Incubators?
The goal of a non-profit incubator is to set up a robust entity that can sustain the creation of value in a local economy. Possible metrics include ongoing impact in the form of new entrepreneurs created, jobs created, and revenue to fuel local economies. According to the Aspen Institute and National Entrepreneurship Network of India (2013) white paper, however, these developments typically take between four to five years to mature and require a ifferent focus, resources, and outcomes along the way as the incubator progresses.
Over the long term, revenue and jobs are goals of an incubator but, according to the white paper, they may also be useful as active indicators to determine the immediate success of the startup.
Ultimately, tracking jobs, revenue, return on investment, and societal impact over a period of four to six years is ideal for measuring impact. This would include the period of incubation (1.5 to three years) and post-incubation (one to three years).
When comparing incubators, additional exogenous factors to consider are geographic location and the local economy—for example, the value of a company and the jobs it creates in a tier 1 town versus a tier 2 town—and the impact on the lives of the people in the community. The impact of a company in terms of education, livelihoods, and life expectancy might differ greatly depending on the location.
The Aspen Institute and National Entrepreneurship Network of India (2013) white paper outlines key challenges that incubators face to become successful—decision implications for partners, funders, and policymakers. Successfully implementing the right metrics and milestones would enable higher motivation, strong incentives, and the propagation of best practice knowledge for greater success of incubators as an industry.
However, classifying incubators and analyzing their metrics helps highlight some key challenges that must both be recognized and dealt with to ensure a higher chance of success.",8566

M&a Overview
Among the tools firms can use to grow, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are perhaps the most daunting. These massive deals are rife with legal and bureaucratic hurdles, but they have created some of the most powerful and recognizable firms in history.
Many companies pursue M&A to grow and transform their businesses. The COVID-19 epidemic has drastically hindered M&As in 2020, but 56 percent of more than 2,900 executives surveyed globally by consultancy EY were planning an acquisition in the next 12 months stating that they were focused on long-term growth despite the current crisis. In fact, the report states that M&A activity may show up an uptick, “If there is any prolonged downturn due to the current crisis, executives may be bolder in their ambitions and look to acquire those assets that will help them accelerate into an upturn faster,” the report said.
M&As in 2020 and beyond are unlike those of past decades. The motives behind these deals have evolved as companies have transitioned to an economy centered around new technologies and the internet. 
Evolving M&A Motives
“M&A goals are changing. Without question, many companies still use deals to achieve economies of scale and improve efficiency. But increasingly, they’re also trying to achieve transformation.” 
— PWC, 2017.
The current COVID-19 epidemic has caused executives to change tacts. Ten years ago, M&As where a way to achieve economies of scale while three years ago, technology and innovation were the drivers for M&As. In 2020, however, securing supply chains are front and center of today’s M&A activity. According to a recent report by EY, “Facing this challenge [COVID-19], executives are now changing their operating models. An unparalleled shutdown of activity in many parts of the world has precipitated new actions, with more than half (52%) of respondents actively taking steps now to change their current supply chain and more than a third (36%) accelerating investment in automation. And the vast majority of those not immediately acting are currently re-evaluating their options.”
Still, EY also found that close to 70% of executives plan to return to a focus on digital and technology (71%) investments once the pandemic is managed. Thus, executives are looking beyond the current crisis and downturn and plan to move nimbly to reinvent their businesses to “help fuel the recovery and create long-term value for all their stakeholders.”
Research from PwC predating the COVID-10 pandemic found that over 50 percent of respondents to a Fortune 1000 survey said that the largest transactions they had completed in the last three years were transformational.
—Source: PwC, 2017
Expand
Further exploring these shifting motivations, the graph below from EY shows the reasons why companies pursued acquisitions in 2017. The most popular reason given by respondents was to develop new products followed by reacting to competitors. The emphasis was on technology advancement rather than factors such as securing better supply chains, organizational efficiency through hiring, or customer management.
—Source: EY, 2017

A Deloitte survey echoes this sentiment. The survey, found in “M&A Trends – Year-end report 2016,” showed that the main goals that companies try to achieve through mergers are related to expansion in products, markets, and technology acquisitions. For example, Walmart is experimenting with alternate e-commerce platforms and acquired Jet, a move that was a huge component in the retailer’s digital transformation. Or consider Target’s acquisition of Shipt to shift to grocery delivery services and follow a new digital direction.

In times of economic normalcy, and once the COVID-19 pandemic is behind us, technology giants will continue to absorb companies to react to digital change. It’s with these motivations in mind that we investigate M&As and how they can drive value amidst digital change.
Defining the M&a Spectrum
There are a few ways to classify deals depending on their intent and structure. The two main classifications of deals are based on functional roles: vertical mergers and horizontal mergers. (A third type, conglomerate mergers, won’t be covered because there is a weaker relationship between these tools and innovation.)
Horizontal Mergers
A horizontal merger, according to Investopedia, “occurs between firms that operate in the same space, as competition tends to be higher and the synergies and potential gains in market share are much greater for merging firms in such an industry.”
Historically, when a company pursued a horizontal M&A and acquired another entity in the same industry or sector space, the purpose was typically to subsume a direct competitor, increase market share, and achieve economies of scale by decreasing average cost. Some of the most visible horizontal deals in recent history have been large companies acquiring startups that have built significant and fast-growing user bases.
It would be impossible to talk about this without mentioning Facebook’s $1 billion acquisition of Instagram. At the time, people were confused by this deal. Why did Facebook pay $1 billion for an app with no revenue and 13 employees? Since the acquisition, the answer has become clear. Instagram has grown from 30 monthly active users to over 800 million. It’s no surprise that the deal has been lauded as one of the greatest acquisitions of the 21st century.
While some analysts were focused on the startup’s non-existent revenue, Facebook saw a product that was taking hold of the younger demographic. It was built for mobile phones, which were experiencing rapid technological advancement at the time. Facebook also understood the opportunities made possible by integrating the two products. Without this integration and symbiotic relationship, it’s doubtful that Instagram would have been able to reach such scale.
Vertical Mergers (Vertical Integration)
“Today, most organizations pursue vertical integration from control, risk, and flexibility standpoints. Control of resources, limiting or taking risks, and flexibly changing direction quickly without the burden of commitments.”
—Erik Kayser, partner and management consultant, Implement Consulting Group.
Vertical deals are an effective way to transform businesses and improve the efficiency of a firm’s value chain. Vertical mergers give firms better control of shipping and logistics, for example, through gig economy shipping, digital platforms, or the acquisition of suppliers.
Target’s acquisition of Shipt was an excellent example. The retailer paid $550 million to acquire the gig economy delivery service and access to same-day fulfillment capabilities in addition to Target’s existing operations. This illustrates a broader trend within retail: integrating the entire vertical. Pressured by Amazon, retailers are using acquisitions to quickly gain access to the whole value chain including supply, fulfillment, e-commerce, physical stores, and more.
Controlling the supply chain can mean controlling the market. Acquiring a vendor or supplier can improve operational efficiency and increase profits by controlling costs and product availability. Starbucks, for example, has vertically integrated from the bean to the cup. The company owns the whole supply chain from the coffee bean farms to the roasting plants, the warehouses, the distribution centers, and the retail outlets.

When and when not to vertically integrate – McKinsey
This article by John Stuckey, director for McKinsey, and David White, principal for McKinsey, is an essential read for anyone thinking about pursuing vertical integration. It is dated 1993 but provides a robust examination of the core components of these deals.
The Search for Synergy
“We look for many singles and doubles on revenue synergy, instead of one home run.” 
– VP of Strategy, Deloitte, 2017.
Companies pursue both vertical and horizontal deals in an attempt to gain synergies, and two types of synergies generally arise from M&As: 1) revenue synergies, when a combined company generates more sales than the two companies could separately, and 2) cost synergies, when the combined company can reduce average costs to a greater extent than the separate companies (economies of scale).
In a Deloitte survey of 528 executives involved in mergers, almost 60 percent of the deal synergies sought were anticipated to come from revenue rather than cost sources. But anticipating synergies is much different than experiencing them. According to McKinsey research, “The greatest errors in estimation appear on the revenue side—which is particularly unfortunate since revenue synergies form the basis of the strategic rationales for entire classes of deals, such as those pursued to gain access to a target’s customers, channels, and geographies. Almost 70 percent of the mergers in our database failed to achieve the synergies expected in this area.”
How can firms increase their chances of experiencing synergies?
In its report, “Revenue Synergies in Acquisitions In Search of the Holy Grail,” Deloitte explains how to achieve revenue synergies. According to the report, combining short-term, quick wins with longer-term creativity could achieve revenue-synergy success. For example, pursuing shared distribution channels can increase synergy and boost revenues in the short term, and pursuing multiple channels can sustain those revenue synergies for longer.
From the beginning, as soon as a deal is announced, Deloitte assigns a project management officer with a relentless focus on synergies and incorporates targets into the operational plan to incentivize teams. The operation plan, according to Deloitte, looks a bit like this.
Pursue the low-hanging fruit
Align around cross-selling and channels
Enforce efficient decision making on goals, being mindful of operating model implications
Cast a wide net
Pursue multiple types of synergy initiatives to increase chances of success
Lead change management activities across both organizations

According to KPMG BOXWOOD, after a merger, “everything is uncertain – office locations, job titles and roles, reward systems, organizational structures, culture and values, the people you work with – they’re all up for discussion.” Announcing key decisions early in the merger discussion process can mitigate the uncertainty among employees and its knock-on effects on revenues.
Another hurdle for the leadership team, according to KPMG BOXWOOD, is to define the new goals of the organization and obtain stakeholder buy-in so that the two entities collaborate from the outset. Preferably, the new goals should not require major changes in thinking from either the collective post-merger organization or the individuals within.
Getting people to let go of old models and ways of thinking is difficult. In the case of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse, KPMG BOXWOOD states that culture surveys and change ready assessments were used to prepare staff for the next steps in the merger and to help them understand and come to terms with change. Staff were shown how the new merged stores would work so that they could envision their roles and anticipate how to manage post-merger day-to-day practicalities. The reason for a merger, and the benefits that it will bring, need to be compelling enough to justify the disruption to affected staff.
Before any merger is contemplated, KPMG BOXWOOD suggests that companies should identify key indicators as benchmarks where improvements are expected. As the merger progresses, these metrics can be used to sustain efforts to make the merger successful. Positive results will build trust in the new leadership and boost morale and productivity. Metrics will also show where changes need to be made, increasing the chance that the merger will be successful.
Use Metrics for a Realistic Picture of Deals
Steve Carnes, an M&A specialist, suggests that companies clearly define goals before deciding what metrics to use to measure merger outcomes. According to Carnes, an organization must decide whether it is focusing on measuring sales or products, building a footprint in a target market, or eliminating a competitor.
Carnes recommends a Sales-Iinventory-Operations-Planning (SIOP) process: “Within a company, people are selling things, making things, and keeping track of how it’s all going. Consider each step, think about your goals, and ask yourself ‘where are the gaps, and how are you going to improve them?’”

Metrics for Integration
Establishing metrics and key indicators to assess the value of entering into a deal will help mitigate risk and facilitate communication with shareholders.
PwC experts Vinay Couto, John Plansky, and Deniz Caglar are the authors of “Fit-for-Growth.” They outline a discipline for companies working through the different stages of preparation for a transformative deal. The discipline calls for alignment of cost structures and capabilities; it also calls for the design of an operating model that enables and sustains cost reductions and then creates the right conditions for managers to drive growth.
For early-stage M&A, Carnes recommends determining whether the target firm’s performance is better than the market average. If not, why do the deal? Carnes suggests looking at year-over-year growth rates for the last three years along with projections for the next three. Market context matters: explosive growth in a hot market might not be impressive.
Carnes also suggests benchmarking employee sales versus the cost ratio with the industry average to determine a company’s performance and potential. Typically, Carnes finds that a lower-than-average ratio indicates problems that might range from brand and market positioning to sales process efficiency or overstaffed departments and a lower level of automation. Carnes advocates looking at the cost of sales per employee and as a percentage of revenue.
Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) are another useful metric. Important items are the targets set for order fulfillment and lead time: does the company meet them, and are these targets essential? Does the value added justify the cost, or are the SLAs not, in fact, a true competitive advantage?
Leading companies are using deals to expand their product lines and to be more competitive in new product development. 
When to Buy Instead of Build: Tech Acquisitions and Acquihires
“I have never cared what something costs; I care what it’s worth.” 
—Ari Emanuel, Talent Agent and co-CEO of William Morris Endeavor
The technology deals market is dynamic, and technology acquisitions are attracting the most attention these days. During the first quarter of 2019, 429 technology deals were announced for a total disclosed deal value of $45.9 billion.

Since 2018, software has been the most active sector, particularly acquisitions of SaaS and data analytics firms.  According to the report by PwC, “AI was a driving force behind several deals, with two of the top four transactions in the semiconductor space being AI-related (Nvidia’s $6.8 billion acquisition of Mellanox and Intel’s $2 billion acquisition of Habana Labs). On the software side, AI companies were popular targets as companies were looking to enter new markets (VMWare’s acquisition of Carbon Black), expand capabilities (Salesforce’s acquisition of ClickSoftware), and innovate new technologies (Facebook’s acquisition of CTRL-labs).” Semi-conductors were the next most active sub-sector, encouraged by the soft chip market and the trade war with China. 
Buying vs. Building
It makes sense that rather than develop a technology from scratch, a company should acquire or merge with another company that already controls that technology. These types of mergers can save years of development time.
The emphasis on technological capabilities over recent years, and the need to acquire such capabilities to be competitive, means that non-digital companies have shown more interest in digital deals (defined as the acquisitions of digital products and services, new digital business models, and the digitization of the value chain).
According to a white paper by Deloitte, digital deals are becoming a fast route to new product markets and technology advancement for many industries. Such deals provide quick and complete access to otherwise unattainable technology in IoT, fintech, cleantech, healthtech, big data and cognitive analytics, robotics, wearables, AI, etc. In fact, according to research from Joerg Krings, advisor to PwC’s strategy consulting group, and J. Neely and Olaf Acker, leading Strategy& and PwC practitioners, companies in non-digital industries completed 48 percent more digital deals in 2015 than they did in 2011.

The Challenges of Technology Deals
Technology deals are vastly different from traditional deals. Rob Fisher, Greg Nahass, and J. Neely, partners with Strategy& and PwC, reference “technology megadeals,” of which Facebook’s $22 million acquisition of the five-year-old startup What’s App in 2014 is a good example. These megadeals often feature “huge valuations, narrow focus, tiny revenues, and entrepreneurial management that may force an acquirer to toss out its playbook.” The tech sector is characterized in many cases by small companies with high valuations, and the decision to acquire, therefore, is a difficult one.
According to a Deloitte white paper, because competition may come from an unexpected source, acquiring firms should identify startups or companies with new or different business models and either acquire them or surpass them. Companies need a way to gauge the value creation potential of a deal, and firms need to know how best to integrate a new tech startup so that value is not lost. Companies now require a completely new skill in the context of mergers: the ability to identify the most promising digital targets from a shortlist that might number in the hundreds.
“Some technology acquisitions that looked good on paper have failed because the purchaser did not really understand what it was buying or its in-house staff did not know the right questions to ask when conducting due diligence.”
—Deloitte, 2011
Although the focus is often on the technology being acquired in a tech deal, a buyer of a startup must consider the revenue synergies to find a competitive valuation. Facebook paid $1 billion for Instagram in 2012, which had no revenue at the time. Did the revenue synergies really amount to that type of valuation?
Facebook recognized that what Instagram offered was integral to their product. Instagram could provide a great photo experience by optimizing the media and adding filters. In addition, the experience also catered to a younger demographic, and Instagram was a product built for mobile, an area in which Facebook was trying to strengthen its offering.
There were also brand synergies. By acquiring Instagram, Facebook not only nullified an emerging competitor, it also gained a valuable property that complements, not substitutes, Facebook Ads. The synergies that Facebook believed it could leverage by buying Instagram amounted to a $1 billion valuation.
Talent Acquisitions (Acquihires)
One type of technology-driven M&A is talent acquisitions, or “acquihires.” These deals seek to acquire human capital competitive advantages, not simply market share, supply chain control, or economies of scale.
“In 2016, GM purchased Sidecar, an app-based ridesharing service provider, acquiring not only the company’s software but also 20 employees—including Sidecar’s cofounder and chief technology officer—with digital skills and know-how.” 
— Rainer Strack , Susanne Dyrchs , Ádám Kotsis , and Stéphanie Mingardon, BCG, 2017
Talent acquisitions are a special type of acquisition mainly seen in the tech industry and in developed tech hubs like Silicon Valley. Leading companies like Facebook and Google buy startups not because they want the projects but because they want the software engineers.
Digitally talented people are already so highly in demand that many large, traditional companies must reinvent themselves to attract these people. According to experts with BCG—Rainer Strack, senior partner; Susanne Dyrchs, project leader; Ádám Kotsis, expert principal, and Stéphanie Mingardon, senior partner—(quoting a Gartner study), 30 percent of tech jobs will be unfilled because of a lack of digital talent. The BCG experts find that the greatest technology challenge is not data security or the need to invest but rather a lack of qualified employees.
Victor Luckerson, reporter for Time, reports that over 221 startup founders joined Google between 2006 and 2014 because of acquisitions, and 110 founders joined Yahoo.
John F. Coyle, assistant professor of Law, and Gregg D. Polsky, professor of Law at the University of North Carolina, explored the acquihire phenomenon. They found that a company’s main motivations for this type of acquisition include obtaining the services of talented engineers and entrepreneurs at one time, hiring a well-functioning team rather than trying to create one from scratch, and using the talents of its new, experienced employee team to enter a new space quickly despite the buying company’s inexperience in that space.
Before considering an acquihire, it’s important to understand what digital skills the company needs, who is available on the market, where the desired talents can be found, and how to attract and retain them.

Talent Acquisition Risks and Hurdles
Acquirers can mitigate the risk of acquiring by taking the time to fully understand the capabilities and goals of the people involved. Is there a good fit? What are the short- and long-term benefits? Those involved should also consider the pertinent skills, technology, and synergies. Are they unique? Will they add value under the new, post-acquihire conditions? How will the acquihire impact competitors? How will the new, acquired staff leverage the newly available resources and infrastructure? Is there an opportunity to acquire new patents?
According to Mark Suster, a partner at Upfront Ventures, a significant risk for companies looking to acquire startup talent is that the main team members of the acquihired company may leave the acquiring company after several years.
Metrics for Talent Acquisition or Acquihiring
“It has been reported that a general rule of thumb in Silicon Valley acquihires is $1 million per engineer.”
—John F. Coyle and Gregg D. Polsky, University of North Carolina, 2013
Coyle and Polsky, in their paper “Acqui-hiring,” note two distinct areas of consideration for buyers: the cost of the deal and the cost of compensation. The authors suggest three main metrics that companies in an acquihiring deal should evaluate:
The number of employees that the buyer wishes to hire
the value of those employees to the buyer, and
the value (if any) of the startup’s intellectual property and other assets to the buyer.

Another perspective is given by Jessica Verrilli, corporate development principal at Twitter. In an interview with Forbes, she said, “We always start by trying to understand what the team set out to build, what their passion is about. Often, they took a swing at it, maybe they didn’t hit it out of the park, but they have a lot of experience. We try to figure out if we’re trying to tackle that problem. Often the conversation ends there if their passion doesn’t match our product needs.”
The third article in this series, “Managing Tech Deals” Continues the theme of technology-driven M&As. It outlines what actions should occur before and after the deal such as due diligence and integration.
Managing Tech Deals
“The rigor and discipline we use in running our business is key to consistently executing our growth strategy. And we systematically applied the same discipline to our investments, including acquisitions.” 
—Pierre Nanterme, Chairman and CEO of Accenture
Before the Deal
Leading up to an M&A deal, valuation is one of the main elements of preparation. But for technology deals where young startups may be involved, Joerg Krings, J. Neely, and Olaf Acker, advisors and practitioners with Strategy&, note that it’s not always so easy to define valuation because there may be no revenue or cash flow on which to base the valuation. Take the Facebook Instagram deal of 2012, for example. In this case, Instagram was a five-year-old startup at the time with no revenue, yet it was acquired by Facebook for $1 billion.
In the case of technology-driven transformation deals where companies acquire as part of a long-term strategy, the price paid might not make sense to investors. Therefore, according to Rob Fisher, Gregg Nahass, and J. Neely, partners with PwC, due diligence is crucial before the deal is made known to investors who may be bemused and less than happy with the high price.
Further adding to the complexity of tech deals is that the due diligence process should be different depending on the type of deal. For example, the scope of due diligence may be limited because the target to be acquired is small, or a billion-dollar company deal may require less due diligence than expected. Big companies may have less to hide than small companies because they have been thoroughly audited or simply because leaders want to keep up the momentum of their innovation work.
James Waletsky, writing for Crosslake, a software consulting firm, lists comprehensive considerations for tech merger due diligence.
Product strategy:
Does the product strategy fit with the investment company’s growth objectives?
What are the product strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT)?
How does the company determine the product roadmap and what will add the most business value?
Product function and quality:
Are there any problems with the product that may be expensive to fix?
Does the product fulfill end user goals or is an expensive UI revamp necessary?
Architecture and code:
Is there anything in the architecture that is an impediment to meeting growth objectives?
Are there legacy components in the software that require replacement? What will this cost?
Are there third-party or open source components that may be problematic from the legal or technical perspective?
Is the code written in a maintainable way such that others can be productive in the code base quickly?
Processes, practices, and tools:
Are there opportunities for efficiency gains and/or cost reduction?
Will the existing practices scale appropriately with company growth?
Are there existing skills gaps that inhibit efficient delivery?
People and organization:
Are the right people in the right roles to meet investment objectives (particularly leaders)?
Who is critical to the business and must be retained with the acquisition?
Are there significant gaps in the organization that must be filled to meet investment objectives?
Is the level of R&D spend appropriate for the company size? Are there opportunities for reduction?
IT/Operations/DevOps:
Are there opportunities for cost reduction, such as a move from locally managed resources to the cloud? What is the cost in doing so?
Is there a suitable business continuity plan in place, and if not, what risk is undertaken and what is required to implement one?
Are the expenditures reasonable given company size?
Are deployment practices efficient with minimal risk of human error?
Product support:
What are the top support call generators that may be indicative of product problems?
How many escalations make their way to the development team?
Professional services:
Are implementation times long, potentially indicating lack of configurability/customization in the product?
Are there opportunities for product enhancement to scale to a larger number of customers requiring less on the services side?
—Source: Waletzky, 2016
According to Waletsky, the risks involved in a tech deal may affect the conditions or price, but the cost of technical due diligence is negligible compared to the potential benefits or costs.
In a white paper, Deloitte has defined a strategic due diligence operation model that can be used for technology deals where a company is targeting companies with dissimilar business models. The model defines some main metrics and identifies which requisite capabilities of the combined company should be retained, changed, or built.

After the Deal
Finalizing a deal is half the battle. After the deal, the hard work of integration begins.
Successful integration may rely on the newly acquired management because the technology that is of value is most likely held by a small group of creative leaders. Experienced managers are needed to oversee smooth operations, particularly when a company is buying large operating units.
Relying on acquired management, however, can be a problem. Some of the senior team from an acquired company may decide to leave after the deal closes and look for other opportunities. Given this potential reality, the acquiring company needs to consider how much it will rely on these senior managers and for how long. According to Fisher, Nahass, and Neely, retaining people contractually is often just a short-term solution.
According to Adam Bluestein, writing for Inc., it’s important to hold on to the people who are integral in a smooth transition, such as technology managers and those with crucial knowledge of the acquired technology. The acquirer needs to keep the managers’ hearts in the game by understanding the environment where people are already thriving and reassuring them that the crucial stuff won’t change – or if it will, providing them with the tools and resources to cope. A change management strategy is vital and should be prepared early in the merger decision process to ensure that the associated costs are considered.
Integration Leadership—Don’t Let Cultural Problems Get in the Way
“When you merge cultures well, value is created. When you don’t, value is destroyed…. The game is won or lost on the field of cultural integration. Get that wrong and nothing else matters.” 
—George Bradt, Chairman, PrimeGenesis
Cultural integration should be part of a change management strategy for mergers. AON found that cultural issues that occur when two entities merge are a main driver of deal failure.

A study by Bain & Company that polled executives who had managed a merger also found that the number one reason given for deal failure was “culture clash.” Team synergies are important and, according to George Bradt, chairman of PrimeGenesis, “Synergies must be created together by teams looking beyond themselves to new problems they can solve for others.”

The culture of an organization is largely set by its leadership. But what if that leadership is in transition?
Dale Stafford and Laura Miles, partners with Bain & Company, recommend cultural integration tools that can gauge the mindset and behaviors of employees and encourage better working processes. Managers and leaders can gain a better perspective of how integration is processing or where changes need to be made.
For example, according to Stafford and Miles, videos of employees working together and process flow maps show the different ways a task is undertaken and can guide a discussion of how it should be done in the future. Customer interviews can provide insights for employees into customer perceptions of each organization, and employee surveys can both collect important data and show employees that their opinion matters—but only if the results stimulate action from leaders.
Divestiture for Value Creation
“Treating divestitures as an afterthought is typical. And it’s a shame.” 
—Gerald Adolph and Ken Favaro, former senior partners at Booz & Company
Divestment can create value for firms by selling assets that detract from core business functions. 
In their HBR article, “Divest With Care,” Gerald Adolph and Ken Favaro, former senior partners with Booz & Company, note that divestiture is often conducted when a firm is restructuring and experiencing a problem. The portfolio examination and the decision to sell assets are made under duress and,  consequently, the company is weakened because assets are most likely sold at a lower price than is necessary.
A better way to approach divestiture is through an ongoing, constant process over the long term, which gives a company time to find the right buyer, sell assets at a much better price, and build a higher-quality portfolio.
If done strategically, a divestiture strategy is another tool that companies can use to create value. According to Ernst & Young’s Corporate Divestment Survey for 2019, over 80 percent of companies plan to streamline their operations through their divestment plans over the next 12 months. 
Moreover, divestiture can be even more beneficial when done in conjunction with acquisitions. Research by McKinsey’s Sean O’Connell, principal, Michael Park, principal, and Jannick Thomsen, associate principal, shows that companies that both acquire and divest create as much as a 1.5 to 4.7 percentage point higher shareholder return than companies that focus mainly on acquisitions.
Google’s divestiture of Motorola illustrates how a strategic divestiture can be a good move for a company.
Google and Motorola: A Lesson in Strategic Divestiture
In 2011, Google announced the acquisition of smartphone manufacturer Motorola for $12.5 billion. Less than three years later, Google sold Motorola to Lenovo for $3 billion—Google portrayed the deal as a success.
Google’s motive behind the deal was “to help supercharge the Android ecosystem by creating a stronger patent portfolio for Google and great smartphones for users,” according to CEO Larry Page.  Rather than maintain the hardware arm’s multi-million dollar yearly operating loss, Google sold off pieces of Motorola while creating a patent portfolio that it is now licensed to Lenovo.
According to Jean Baptiste Su, VP and Principal Analyst at Atherton Research, Google came out ahead, receiving patents valued at $5.5 billion at a cost of around $1 billion.
Further, Google transformed Motorola in the process. The company released two highly rated budget phones during its time at Google: the Moto X and the Moto G. Through this move, Motorola became an attractive acquisition target and quality, budget phones spread the use of Android, a key value driver for Google.
The strategy, though, would not have been successful without careful and deliberate planning, which is increasingly difficult in this climate. How should firms approach divestiture in the fast-moving acquisition climate where technology is playing such a huge role? And what distinguishes a good deal from a bad deal?
Identifying Assets & Divestment
The 2018 Corporate Divestment Study from Ernst and Young suggests that firms should identify how technology is changing their business model. Firms should divest to improve their competitive edge, which means focusing on the core business and having enough liquidity to react to opportunities as they arise.
In 2020, COVID-19 has changed the landscape. The 2020 Corporate Divestment Study from Earnst and Young EY surveyed 25 global activist investors in January 2020, and again in April 2020. The data show that companies consider divestiture more urgent to create focus and simplicity. Over 90 percent of those surveyed recommend that a target company divest non-core or underperforming businesses, up from 64% previously. The timeframe should also be shorter. Before the crisis, 36% of activists suggested a timeframe of within six months for divestiture, but this number has increased to 84%. According to the report, “companies should prepare for investor discussions that focus on how they are responding to the crisis, aligning the portfolio to their core strategy, and other matters such as executive compensation alignment relative to company performance.” There must be a focus on “freeing up capital to build resilience and drive long-term value.”
Reviewing possible divestitures in conjunction with a normal portfolio review means that assets are assessed each year. A scoring system based on algorithms and industry criteria, for example, can rate an asset based on growth potential or to what extent the asset uses resources that might be better allocated to core activities. Low-scoring assets are candidates for divestiture. Managers who have an interest in the asset can present their rationale for keeping the asset, and organization leaders can make the final decision of whether to keep it.
Managers focus on finding a buyer but seldom look at a deal from the buyer’s point of view. Doing so can add clarity to what should be included in the sale in addition to the obvious productive assets.
Preparing for Divestment
Even if companies take a strategic approach to divestiture, problems can arise after deciding what to sell. O’Connell, Park, and Thomsen suggest the following steps when planning divestments:
Prepare for a buyer before there is a need for a buyer. Companies should prepare for possible divestitures before there is a need to sell. An asset could be worth more to one buyer than another because of potential synergies, so waiting to divest until it’s necessary to do so will not provide enough time to find the right deal.
Considering other potential buyers. Evaluating the value of a non-core business is difficult. Executives often overlook an asset’s potential value to others, so external perspectives help (for example, from bankers, potential owners, and industry CEOs).
Invest for mutual success. Deals that aren’t well-prepared can be costly for both the buyer and the seller, and the outcome of divestiture for both parties is linked. Firms, then, should prepare divestiture candidates for post-deal success just as much as they prepare for price negotiations by understanding the asset’s potential sources of value. Giving the new owners supporting documentation, strategy suggestions, or data on potential improvements can increase the likelihood of a successful transaction for both parties.
Commit resources for post-deal success. Ensure there is the right managerial talent and supporting knowledgeable staff. According to Fubini, Park, and Thomas, partners with McKinsey, managers tend to think about the separation process as secondary, assuming they can separate a business and worry about stranded costs later. It’s also important to consider the internal conflict that can occur between outgoing managers and those who are staying. Finally, ensure that management and the board don’t get so caught up in the sale that the core business is neglected and suffers.

Case Study on Cisco
Because the models for M&A leadership success vary greatly depending on the context and the personality of the leader, we present a summary case study on Cisco, a company that has mastered the art of acquisition. We also provide insightful quotes from business leaders who describe their own experience with mergers.
Leadership is paramount during times of upheaval, providing direction and strategy during mergers and determining personnel policies that can maintain morale. The CEO is front and center, but the accountability of all C-suite executives with respect to deal success has changed over time.

There is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to managing a merger; so many variables apply depending on the context, the culture, and the personalities involved. Rather than follow “how to”’ guides, it is more valuable to study the past experiences of others and learn from their successes and mistakes.
Cisco has mastered the art of acquisition having bought over 100 companies within 13 years. The following case study explains the company’s strategy and the rationale behind some of the deals. Cisco provides an excellent model for deal management for technological growth.
“We make acquisitions that get us into very new markets …. And we also make acquisitions in areas that are transitions within markets we already participate in. Meraki is the transition with cloud networking. Insieme Networks was about SDN in the data center. Cisco has a proven model for driving a lot of value in markets we understand that are undergoing transition, and that’s what we plan to do with Viptela.” 
—Rob Salvagno, head of corporate development, Cisco.
Cisco is one of the leading companies in technology and a leader in M&A strategy. The company bought more than 100 companies between 1993 and 2016. Five of their biggest deals were OpenDNS ($635 million), Meraki ($1.2 billion), Sourcefire ($2.7 billion), NDS Group ($5 billion), Jasper Technologies ($1.4 billion), and Lancope ($452.5 million).
Cisco defines its growth strategy as one that identifies and drives market transition. The company separates acquisitions into three segments: market acceleration, market expansion, and new market entry.
The company focuses on integration by investing in dedicated integration resources across the company. For Cisco, integration is a process that starts with the entire acquisition strategy. The company seeks acquisitions based on a strong business case but also a shared business and technology vision.
“We invest $100 million to $200 million in startups a year. Situations like AppDynamics and Meraki show we can move at a pace that is really unequal by other people and that we have a playbook to make those successful that is also unrivaled. When we acquired Meraki four years ago [for $1.2 billion], it was at a $100 million bookings rate. Today it’s exceeding a $1 billion booking rate. We can anticipate where the market is going because of that lens we have as investors. We pioneered the spin-in model and did our first set of divestitures, and we are beginning to build that muscle up.”

“A lot of what I’m focused on is how we drive the innovation ecosystem to complement Cisco’s traditional engineering motion, how we drive external engagement with startups, how we look at opportunities to augment what we’re doing inside the company through acquisitions, and how we develop next-generation partnerships at global scale, like we have with Ericsson and Apple.” 
—Hilton Romanski, chief strategy officer, Cisco
“Our Integration Team is a unique project office that allows us to successfully integrate the acquisitions we make as well as run complex programs related to our next-gen partnerships. As you know, we make between eight and 12 acquisitions a year, so having a talented team in place to help support M&A is crucial. Having a dedicated team in place to help us plan for, manage, execute, and then look back on our deals is a strategic differentiator for Cisco.” 
—Hilton Romanski, chief strategy officer, Cisco
What are the reasons behind some of Cisco’s acquisitions?
The acquisition of Observable Networks
“The acquisition of Observable Networks supports Cisco’s strategic transition toward software-centric solutions that deliver predictable recurring revenue. Together, Cisco and Observable Networks will extend the Cisco Stealthwatch solution into the cloud with highly scalable behavior analytics and comprehensive visibility. The acquisition also extends Stealthwatch to the Mid-Market customer segment.”
—Cisco, 2017
The acquisition of MindMeld
“MindMeld believes that a truly human-like conversational experience requires highly customized and domain-specific trained language models. By focusing MindMeld’s capabilities on Cisco’s specific collaboration domains, we believe we will enable a user experience that will be differentiated from anything that exists in the collaboration space today.” 
—Cisco, 2017
The acquihire of an Advanced Analytics team from Saggezza
“By adding a team of analytics experts, Cisco will augment our current analytics capabilities so we can improve insights into network performance and automation, accelerate Cisco DNA development efforts, and enhance our cloud and SaaS analytics offerings. The acquisition is a reflection of our strong belief that analytics will play a critical role in the building of next-generation networks designed for an era of cloud, IoT, and pervasive security threats.” 
—Cisco Advanced Analytics Team from Saggezza, 2017
“This acquisition is aligned to Cisco’s strategic goals to develop innovative big data analytics and cloud technologies while also cultivating top talent.” 
—Cisco Advanced Analytics Team from Saggezza, 2017
The acquisition of AppDynamics
“Cisco and AppDynamics’s capabilities are very complementary. Cisco delivers comprehensive data collection and insights in the datacenter, network, and security domains. While AppDynamics bring the industry-leading solutions for application, end user, and business transaction insights together, Cisco and AppDynamics will break the silos of application, infrastructure, and security domains to help organizations evolve from managing IT performance to managing digital business performance and business transactions. As part of Cisco, AppDynamics will complement current Cisco product initiatives to provide end-to-end IT intelligence platforms that offer customers holistic visibility, correlation, and insights across IT domains—from the code to the end user and everywhere in between.” 
—Cisco, 2017
“The acquisition of AppDynamics is part of Cisco’s broader strategy to drive growth for the company, our customers, and our partners.”

Insights From M&a Strategy Leaders
Cisco is a pioneer in M&A, but there are countless other leaders and experts. This section is composed of direct quotes from top executives who are handling the M&A activities of some of the biggest companies in the world.
Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook
Mark Zuckerberg gave rare insight into how he approaches acquisitions during public testimony in a Dallas courtroom, and his responses were reported by Alex Heath, writer for Business Insider.
On building long-time relationships before acquisitions
“I’ve been building relationships, at least in Instagram and the WhatsApp cases, for years with the founders and the people that are involved in these companies … when it became time or when we thought it was the right time to move, we felt like we had a good amount of context and had good relationships so that we could move quickly, which was competitively important and why a lot of these acquisitions, I think, came to us instead of our competitors and ended up being very good acquisitions over time that a lot of competitors wished they had gotten instead.” 
—Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, Facebook, Business Insider, 2018
On having a shared vision
“The most important thing was aligning and getting excited about a shared vision and about how we’re going to work together. Or, if they built the hardware and we built the experiences, how that could be better than either of us working separately.” 
—Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, Facebook, Business Insider, 2018
Peggy Johnson, EVP of Business Development at Microsoft
In an interview, Peggy Johnson, EVP of business development at Microsoft, gives insights into Microsoft’s M&A strategy. She discusses the type of companies and the deals they pursue, how the M&A team functions in Microsoft, and the areas they target.
On looking at one main indicator
“Deals are always a bit lumpy. We look at: Is it solving a problem for us? And if it does, we move to acquisition.” 
—Peggy Johnson, EVP of business development, Microsoft
On M&A team organization
“M&A at Microsoft is a team sport for the senior leadership group. They’re all involved in it, and we all play different roles. My role is the first centralized business development role at Microsoft. The team previously had been embedded in the product groups …. Now we can sit across all the major groups of the companies, and we have much more flexibility.” 
—Peggy Johnson, EVP of business development, Microsoft
On valuation
“Valuations are always much-debated. I try to center on what is the value to us. Is it solving a problem for us? If it is, we find a way to proceed. If the valuation has been overhyped on something and it doesn’t make sense, we won’t. It’s very simple for me. I tend not to worry too much about the valuation. It’s really what the value is to us.” 
—Peggy Johnson, EVP of business development, Microsoft
On ROI
“We have to balance strategic opportunities versus ROI. We ask the team to show us the path to commercialization and path to ROI. We are very disciplined and rigorous in our approach and super focused on monitoring the investment. We do it all within my team – we don’t rely on the product groups to track the investments.” 
—Peggy Johnson, EVP of business development, Microsoft
John Somorjai, EVP of Corporate Development and Salesforce Ventures
In an interview with Fortune magazine, John Somorjai, EVP of corporate development and Salesforce Ventures gives insights on Salesforce’s M&A strategy, their areas of focus, how their strategy is driven by customer needs, and how they approach valuations.
On accessing the best technology
“AI, mobility, and big data are driving a lot of the profound changes you’re seeing in businesses overall. We found we needed to accelerate our efforts to make sure we were accessing the best technology we could deliver to our customers quickly and also bring in some really great talent, especially in the AI space.” 
—John Somorjai, EVP of Corporate Development and Salesforce Ventures, 2017
On M&A approach
“We generally take the same approach each year. Because we’re product-focused and product-driven, we’re reactive to the environment. When we see products or developments or large companies that are solving a problem in a new way, that drives M&A interest.” 
—John Somorjai, EVP of Corporate Development and Salesforce Ventures, 2017
Don Harrison, Head of Corporate Development, Google
In an interview with Fortune, Don Harrison who heads up corporate development at Google, gives insights on Google’s M&A strategy, the company’s priorities, its focus on AI, and the approach to divestitures.
On valuation metrics
“It’s very hard to apply valuation metrics to AI. These acquisitions are driven by key talent — really smart people. It’s an area I’m focused on and our team is focused on. The valuations are part and parcel of the promise of the technology. We pay attention to it but don’t necessarily worry about it.” 
—Don Harrison, corporate development, Google
On the most important elements for deal success
“M&A will never be 100 percent successful, and we learn from every deal we do. And so not to pick on any specific deal, but I’ve learned, based on relative success of deals we’ve done in the past, to make sure the key leaders at the company share a vision with the founder, that the strategy drives the M&A, as opposed to the M&A driving the strategy, and that we have good support mechanisms for these companies after they come in.” 
—Don Harrison, corporate development, Google
On divestiture
“I think Niantic [creator of the popular Pokémon Go game] is our most famous divestiture. We have done divestitures, and I’m a fan of us thinking about that actively. Google is still very much in growth mode. When I look at Sundar’s and Alphabet’s strategy, I see broadening the vision. We should continue to make good bets across a variety of areas and recognize that some of those aren’t going to succeed, and divestiture becomes a good home.” 
—Don Harrison, corporate development, Google
Robert Weiler, VP of Oracle’s Global Business Units (GBU)
In an interview with Fortune, EVP of Oracle’s Global Business Unit, Robert Weiler, gives insights into Oracle’s M&A strategy, how their Global Business Unit works, and what they look for in an acquisition.
On small deals
“But while Oracle is no stranger to making big purchases at opportune times, such as its $10.3 billion acquisition of PeopleSoft in 2004 or its $8.5 billion acquisition of BEA Systems in 2008, the bulk of its deal flow will most likely remain modest in its size and narrow in its scope. Such small deals usually draw yawns from financiers (and news editors), but it is all part of Oracle’s overall business strategy to dominate and control the most profitable industry verticals in the business software (read: cloud computing) world, all without drawing attention to itself or its affiliates.” 
—Robert Weiler, EVP Global Business Units, Oracle
On M&A strategy and GBU structure
“The strategy, which Oracle co-founder and executive chairman Larry Ellison devised years ago, involves first acquiring companies that make software considered a “must-have” for a particular industry. The acquired companies are then placed into semi-autonomous business groups called Global Business Units that are industry-specific (e.g., financial services or health sciences) and have their own organizational structure (each has its own general manager, development, sales, marketing, consulting, and M&A strategy). The GBU structure now encompasses seven business units made up of 33 acquired companies with a total deal value of around $15 billion. Oracle will expand into any industry vertical it thinks it can come to dominate and can snap up a company in the blink of an eye.” 
—Robert Weiler, EVP Global Business Units, Oracle
On integrating the acquired team
“Larry’s view was that you lose domain expertise in big organizations because it scatters and naturally dilutes. You come back two years after an acquisition and you can’t find the company, the nucleus that made the company great. So, he said for industry applications, “I am going to keep that nucleus.” As such, when we acquire a company, the development team and sales people are still working on the same thing. Occasionally, we’ll change some things within a vertical, but they’re all around the same passion and solution.” 
—Robert Weiler, EVP Global Business Units, Oracle
Apple
Bloomberg gives an overview of Apple’s M&A strategy, the type of companies it buys, and the composition of its deals team.
On Apple’s deals team
“Apple’s deals team is composed of about a dozen people under former Goldman Sachs banker Adrian Perica, and most acquisitions take place at the behest of the company’s engineers. Product managers usually meet every month with Perica’s team members to identify targets with attractive technology or talented engineers, according to a person familiar with the process.” 
—Alex Webb and Alex Sherman, Bloomberg, 2017

About the Guide:
Discovering a breakthrough product makes for transformational innovation; a novel concept can disrupt an industry in one fell swoop and catapult a firm to market leadership. It is the dream of innovators.
Frustratingly, transformational innovation is also elusive. According to Jay Terwilliger, writer for Creative Realities, Inc., an innovation consulting firm, “transformational innovation is exceedingly rare. Think about it: how many truly new-to-the-world ideas happen in a year? In a lifetime? Not many!”
The scarcity of breakthroughs is largely because few occur organically. Breakthroughs occur with hard work, focus, and often long-term effort to explore a vision, solve a problem, or tweak an existing prototype, and that’s all before the product is successfully brought to market. So, what is it that keeps firms investing heavily in R&D and pursuing ever-distant, world-changing concepts?
Perhaps the more realistic purpose of R&D investment is to sustain a competitive market position in an environment where advances are coming thick and fast. R&D investment builds the moats, through IP and operational efficiencies, that can secure a firm’s future amidst the seemingly infinite barrage of competition from corporates and startups alike. That is what R&D means to firms and why it is so important to them. Fall behind and fall out of the market.
Research and development (R&D) has existed since the first corporation. Defined by Investopedia as “the investigative activities a business conducts to improve existing products and procedures or to lead to the development of new products and procedure.”
Some of the world’s most recognizable innovations are products of R&D labs. In the past, AT&T’s Bell Labs gave us the transistor and the cellular telephone. Today, we see R&D products in the form of Amazon Echo, Google’s autonomous car unit, and digital health wearables that measure heart vitals, temperature, and can track when someone falls. The breakthroughs are irrefutable — but what is less difficult to quantify, is how best to pursue R&D. What strategies work? How much should a firm invest in R&D? What factors lead to breakthroughs or transformation innovation?
The following two articles attempt to answer the questions that today’s CEOs and entrepreneurs have concerning the value of R&D, best practices to follow, and how to develop a focused plan that builds creativity and an R&D portfolio while technology is rapidly advancing around them.
The State of Modern R&D
“The enterprise that does not innovate ages and declines. And in a period of rapid change such as the present, the decline will be fast.” 
— Peter Drucker, Legendary business author and management consultant
The appetite for R&D investment is on the rise spurred by technology advancements such as artificial intelligence, AR and VR, robotics, and 3D printing. All of these technologies and more are paving the way for new products that are changing the way we live and work.
This appetite is reflected by huge R&D corporate budgets. Specialist R&D tax advisers Swanson Reed reported that, in 2015, business R&D spending reached $356 billion in the United States, an increase from the previous year of close to 5 percent. Swanson Reed also reported that companies are also investing more of their own funds in R&D, particularly manufacturing companies, which accounted for over 60 percent of domestic R&D spending.
This torrent of R&D activity, somewhat based on the belief of many that R&D is the way to market leadership, belies the fact that no scientific correlation has been found between R&D expenditure and company performance.
According to Tendayi Viki, Managing Partner at Benneli Jacobs, a strategy and innovation consultancy firm, the belief that R&D spending is somehow connected to increased innovation, revenue growth and profits is just a presumption.
PwC’s Strategy& has published the top 1,000 most innovative companies in its annual report for the past 12 years or more. Interestingly, each year, the top 10 most innovative companies are rarely the top 10 spenders on R&D.
So, why are companies investing so heavily in a strategy that has no empirical connection to  profits?
Fundamentally, companies spend on R&D to stay ahead of the curve. While sales and operations keep companies afloat, R&D is among the tools that companies must leverage to evolve and prepare for the future. Unlike some of the other tools in the growth and innovation arsenal focused on discovering and fast-following opportunities, R&D is a long-term strategy that creates original moats supported by intellectual property and unique efficiencies. While spending on R&D may not bring the instant lucrative breakthrough, it keeps a company on a level playing field with its competitors as technology and industry practices advance (in addition to providing tax benefits.)
How Big Tech Does R&D
While corporations are spending more than ever on R&D, at the same time, R&D productivity on a national level is on the decline. Further, The United States has dropped out of the top 10 in Bloomberg’s Innovation Index.
While R&D is struggling on a macro-level, the leaders in the modern economy —  “ Big Tech” (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, etc) — all have fruitful R&D programs. In the following section, we dive into examples of Big Tech R&D strategy.
Choosing an R&D strategy requires following a model, preferably one based on quantifiable data. One problem that Knott’s RQ highlights is the difficulty inherent in determining the impact of R&D.
R&D is difficult to benchmark among firms because R&D practices and strategies are unique to individual firms. For example, Amazon’s practice of expensing R&D hides the firm’s economic earnings. According to Valens Research, for Amazon, “GAAP guidelines that require R&D costs to either be expensed or capitalized from acquisitions as in-process, or written off later leads to a low-quality earnings number and an unreliable balance sheet.”
Therefore, comparing the results of R&D across different companies and industries to find patterns, as Knott did, is troublesome. For example, tech companies spend more on R&D than any other companies in the United States (23 percent in 2017, according to PwC). In contrast, consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies are spending a fraction of that (3 percent in 2017, according to PwC), and 60 to 80 percent of their budgets go towards renovation and maintenance of existing products.

Zoom in on tech companies and the picture becomes even murkier. As a percentage of revenue, firms such as Apple spend very little on R&D, 3 percent, while Facebook spends 21 percent, according to Alice Truong, reporter for Quartz.

Comparisons of industries and firms are problematic because there are so many variables.
This lack of relationship doesn’t mean R&D shouldn’t be pursued – Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft all have high (and increasing) R&D expenditures and are also considered some of the most innovative in the world. Although R&D is a highly individualized process and trends cannot be easily measured on a macro-level, we can look to these big tech firms as a valuable source of examples of what good R&D looks like.
R&D Case Studies
Headlines exemplify the race to the next breakthrough transformational that is ongoing among the market leaders. For example:
“Google continues its explosive spending on R&D,” Chris O’Brian, VentureBeat
“Amazon Is Spending Insane Amounts of Money on Research So That It Keeps Crushing Rivals,” Lindsay Rittenhouse, The Street
“Apple R&D Spend Exceeds $3 Billion for the First Time, up $410 Million from September,” Mikey Campbell, Appleinsider
“Alibaba is Doubling its R&D Spend to $5 billion — But that’s Less Than a Third of What Amazon Spends,” Rani Molla, Recode
Here’s a closer look at two of the most interesting R&D leaders, Amazon and Google, and their approaches to R&D.
Amazon: R&D as a Culture
Expand
Amazon’s most visible efforts are found in Lab126, an R&D subsidiary based in Sunnyvale, California. This is the branch responsible for all of the hardware products tied to Amazon — the Kindle, Echo, and the [ashamed] Fire Phone. The lab continues to push out devices, launching the Echo Show, Echo Spot, and redesigning the Fire TV and original Echo — all within a matter of months.
According to Dan Gallagher, reporter for The Wall Street Journal, Amazon spent over $5.5 billion in the second quarter of 2017, which was a year-over-year increase of over 40 percent, and the firm shows no signs of slowing its R&D expenditures.
Amazon’s profitability has benefited from its growing cloud business, which has provided some buffer against the R&D spending that does not provide breakthrough products. But Amazon persists in R&D even in markets where it is already beating its rivals.
Amazon’s Echo dominates the voice-activated speaker market yet the company has issued a newer version that is priced 45 percent less than its predecessor, a move expected to increase the market value of Echo five-fold by 2026. And, referring to the Alexa platform, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said: “expect us to double down.”
Expand
To better understand the origin of Amazon’s R&D strategy, we can look at Bezos’ 2010 Letter to Shareholders. Bezos explains why Amazon aggressively invests in technology, and it goes beyond Lab126:
“All the effort we put into technology might not matter that much if we kept technology off to the side in some sort of R&D department, but we don’t take that approach. Technology infuses all of our teams, all of our processes, our decision-making, and our approach to innovation in each of our businesses. It is deeply integrated into everything we do.” Bezos adds, “these techniques are not idly pursued – they lead directly to free cash flow.”
This quote explains the importance of R&D activities while at the same time highlighting aspects of Amazon’s culture: innovation and growth are built into every segment of the company, not just R&D.
Amazon’s R&D strategy suggests many best practices. Here are two:
Use technology throughout an organization not just as part of partitioned R&D activities.
Recognize core competencies and maximize them.
Google X: Searching for Radical Breakthroughs
R&D, rather than siloed off to a separate corporate arm or department with a separate budget, is often tied throughout a company’s operations, as is evident in Bezos’ letter to shareholders. At the same time, R&D can also be responsible for many of these companies most ambitious (and sometimes bizarre) projects that are not part of a firm’s core competencies.
Google has a sandbox meant solely for these types of projects — “X.” X, aptly subtitled, “The Moonshot Factory,” focuses on radical projects that are 10 times better than any existing solution. Why? According to Astro Teller, director of Google X, a 10 times improvement is often easier than a 10 percent improvement.
Teller explains that when looking for a 10 percent improvement, a company is tied to existing technologies and solutions, but when shooting for 10 times, anything goes. Moonshots are at the intersection between a huge problem, a radical solution, and a breakthrough technology.
The most visible effort from Google X is its autonomous car project, spun out as an Alphabet Subsidiary called Waymo. The Waymo moonshot is framed as follows:
Problem: Close to 1.25 million people die on roads every year globally, and 94 percent of those accidents are caused by human error.
Radical Solution: What if cars could drive people safely from point A to point B at the push of a button — without needing a human to take over driving at any time?
Breakthrough Technology: Vehicles could have built-in sensors to detect pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles, road work and more from a distance of up to two football fields away in all directions. Smart software could predict the behavior of objects and road users to help the vehicle navigate the vehicle safely through everyday traffic.
— Source: Waymo, 2017
Today, Waymo is the frontrunner in the autonomous car space. Lucinda Shen, reporter for Fortune, writes that analysts from Morgan Stanley have estimated the firm’s value at or near $70 billion dollars. Waymo struck a partnership in 2017 with Lyft, which has the second biggest volume in U.S. ride service. Further, Shen reports that Waymo and Honda are close to finalizing a deal to build automated delivery vehicles, which is a significant commercialization push from a giant that generates around 90 percent of its revenue from advertising. But this success doesn’t come without struggles.
Google X kills projects — a lot of them. For every Waymo or Verily (Google X’s life science spinoff), there are countless projects that don’t make the cut. “We killed over 100 investigations last year alone,” Teller states in a 2017 Ted talk.
The organization moves quickly, fails a lot, and iterates based on feedback. Teller describes the thought process behind the killing of their buoyant cargo ship project:
“However cheap they would be in volume, though, we found out it was likely to cost close to $200 million for the R&D and materials to design and construct the first one. Since X is structured around tight feedback loops of making mistakes, learning, and new designs, $200 million is way too expensive for us to get the first data point on whether we’re on the right track.”
— Astro Teller
This cost-benefit analysis must run through every decision, from the mundane to the risky. Both organizations, Google and Amazon, exemplify a mastery over the R&D portfolio, allocating resources to both incremental and radical advancements.
Google’s R&D strategy also suggests best practices that the lay company can apply:
Balance risk and potential breakthrough goals with investor and stakeholder tolerance.
Develop a cut-throat portfolio selection strategy.
Metrics and Best Practices for R&d Optimization
“Chief executives struggle to make the case to the Street that their managerial actions can be relied on to yield a stream of successful new offerings…The pursuit of the new feels haphazard and episodic.”
— Bansi Nagji and Geoff Tuff, partners at Monitor Group
Ninety-nine percent of mature companies fail when entering new markets, which makes bold R&D ventures both high risk and costly. Long-term investment in R&D can yield gains over a prolonged time horizon, but that can be a hard sell to investors and board members who seek short-term results. However, CEOs and businesses can develop an R&D strategy that straddles the need for long-term investment and growth with governance, financial, and competitive pressures.
The way that a portfolio is managed reflects a company’s organizational culture and infrastructure. If a company doesn’t already have a culture that accepts risk or an infrastructure that shields labs from day-to-day operations, then robust, data-driven assessments (ROI, value assessments) will be the only way to convince stakeholders to invest. But, this is short-sighted.
For more on culture, see our guide on building a culture of innovation with examples from Microsoft, Netflix, Facebook and more.
Bansi Nagji and Geoff Tuff are partners at Monitor Group and leaders of the firm’s global innovation practice. They have researched best practices for R&D portfolio management considering the pressures of market expectations, investors, and global competition.
Nagji and Tuff discuss three types of R&D, or innovation, that they have incorporated into an Innovation Ambition Matrix: core innovation, which is based on optimizing existing products; adjacent innovation, which expands existing business and products; and transformative innovation, which aims to develop breakthrough products.
The authors developed the Innovation Ambition Matrix to help companies in their decisions to allocate funds to R&D and growth initiatives, and they explain it in detail in their article in the Harvard Business Review.
Nagji and Tuff explain that for some projects, estimating returns to develop an R&D portfolio is easy. Traditional financial metrics such as net present value and ROI are applicable and straightforward when evaluating R&D aligned with the core business. These calculations assume variables such as adoption rates and price points of new products or ideas, which is entirely feasible for core products.
However, where transformation efforts are concerned, making such assumptions is impractical. Some products are abstract, some products build platform stickiness and, in some cases, to quote the late Steve Jobs, “People don’t know what they want until you show it to them.” Estimating transformational ROI and attempting data-drive assessments, in this context, is pointless. Companies need to think differently.
The Innovation Ambition Matrix
Source: Nagji and Tuff, 2012
Expand
The matrix helps managers to assess ongoing R&D initiatives, the number of initiatives and the level of investment. It provides a way to shape the overall ambition for the company’s innovation, whether it be short or long-term small projects that complement existing products, or high-risk efforts that might offer a breakthrough or a bigger payoff.
But there’s an additional problem in addition to the difficulties in valuing transformational R&D strategies.Nagji and Tuff found that, because chief executives often do not have a strong grasp of the myriad initiatives that might already be underway in their organizations, R&D can be haphazard and episodic.
According to Nagji and Tuff, “the companies that have a strong track record of creative endeavors articulate a clear R&D ambition, balance core and transformational ventures, and have the infrastructure, tools, and capabilities to manage and integrate initiatives.”
Determining R&D Focus
Beyond the core, adjacent, and transformational lens introduced above, firms must decide on where to focus their R&D efforts in relation to their product offerings. For the majority of companies, the focus has shifted towards software. From Strategy&’s, “Software as a Catalyst” report:
“Most of the world’s major innovators are in the midst of the same transformational journey. R&D is shifting more and more toward developing software and services. Software increasingly carries the burden of enabling product differentiation and adaptability, and enhancing customer experiences and outcomes.
This transition is for a good reason — it’s the same tactic that has skyrocketed tech giants ahead of the competition. According to Ben Thompson of Stratechery, “while digital infrastructure obviously needs to be maintained, by-and-large the investment reaps dividends far longer than the purchase of any physical good.”
— Strategy&
Thompson goes on to provide examples of the strides made due to tech giants’ R&D:
It was expensive to develop mainframes, but IBM could reuse the expertise to build them and most importantly the software needed to run them; every new mainframe was more profitable than the last.
It was expensive to develop Windows, but Microsoft could reuse the software on all computers; every new computer sold was pure profit.
It was expensive to build Google, but search can be extended to anyone with an Internet connection; every new user was an opportunity to show more ads.
It was expensive to develop iOS, but the software can be used on billions of iPhones, every one of which generates tremendous profit.
It was expensive to build Facebook, but the network can scale to two billion people and counting, all of which can be shown ads.
Aside from a general preference for software, metrics can help guide firms efforts and spending when creating a research and development portfolio.

Where Companies Fail in Selecting an Optimal R&D Portfolio
R&D, like any investment, should maximize returns over time. All too often, governance, stakeholder, and consumer pressures mean that short-term developments are prioritized over radical change that requires a longer time horizon. A study by Rachelle Sampson and Yuan Shi of the University of Maryland found a correlation between failure to invest in the long term and a decrease in a firm’s innovativeness.
But the issue isn’t as simple as telling executives to focus more on the future. There are many other factors that come into play when allocating funding to projects. A study by researchers Paola Criscuolo, Linus Dahlander, Thorsten Grohsjean, and Ammon Salter published in the Academy of Management journal found that many R&D funding decisions were undermined by simple human bias:
“The Biases That Keep Good R&D Projects from Getting Funded (…) R&D selection is not always based on objective estimates of a project’s costs and returns. We found that funding decisions in this organization were influenced by how novel a project seemed. Proposals that were deemed either too novel or not novel enough got little or no funding.”
— Criscuolo, Dahlander, Grohsjean and Salter
Expand
The illustration above developed by Criscuolo, Dahlander, Grohsjean, and Salter illustrates how R&D selection is not always conducted scientifically. How can this problem be overcome, and a best practice instituted for portfolio selection? Metrics can serve as the guide.
Metrics for R&D
R&D Portfolios
A portfolio for R&D should reflect a company’s position regarding risk and reward. According to Nagji and Tuff, that means building a portfolio that produces the highest overall return and that meets its appetite for risk.
In Managing Your Innovation Portfolio, Bansi Nagji and Geoff Tuff state that a combination of noneconomic and internal metrics can best assess transformational efforts in their early stages. For example, one achievement of an R&D initiative is that a team learns by exploring and experimenting.
“For example, what if the only hurdle an initiative must clear to receive continued investment is that the company is likely to learn (not earn) from it? That is how Google has assessed transformational innovation from the start,” state Nagji and Tuff.
This concept of valuing organizational learning can be a tough sell, but it’s an important one. The most innovative companies are all known for their tolerance of failure and their belief in building a learning organization. This is central to their cultures that fuel growth and innovation.
Metrics to measure learning are, therefore, crucial because when ROI is not a persuasive metric where investors are concerned – and it is not where transformational R&D is concerned – much of a company’s value is realized in the learning that is achieved and the knowledge and talent amassed in employees based on their professional experience both inside and outside the organization.
A more quantifiable, traditional measure is the number of patents.
Measuring Patents
The number of patents is one measure of R&D efficacy that has persisted for years. On the surface, this makes sense. Many researchers within R&D departments come from academic backgrounds and published papers are signals of success. However, this measure is the equivalent of a blunt instrument when assessing a firm’s innovativeness.
Patents are subject to a number of confounding variables. For instance, if the firm partners with a university, there is a higher propensity to patent. If the firm conducts international business, there is a higher propensity to patent. Further, tech companies are moving towards open-source software development, resulting in a lower propensity to patent. These factors hinder patents’ value as a measure of communicating value to stakeholders or the greater market.
These limitations have led experts to creating novel metrics to better address the complexities of R&D success.
Modern Metrics for R&D
According to Anne Marie Knott, professor in Business at Washington University’s Olin Business School in St. Louis and author of the book “How Innovation Really Works,” “despite all the experts dedicated to helping companies innovate, the money companies spend on R&D is producing fewer and fewer results. In fact, my research shows the returns to companies’ R&D spending have declined 65 percent over the past three decades.”
To arrive at her conclusions, Knott used a metric that she developed to measure R&D productivity – the output that firms get in return for innovation inputs – which she calls research quotient, or RQ. This metric is a useful one for managers trying to secure R&D budgets from decision makers and investors. RQ calculates the percentage increase in revenue from a 1 percent increase in R&D spending across the organization (for the theory of RQ, see “Estimating Firms’ Research Quotient (RQ)”.)
The decline that Knott sees in the RQ of companies mirrors the overall decline in GDP growth in the United States for the past 30 years.
Knott suggests three theories that might explain the declining trend in returns from R&D spending. The first is that R&D work is more difficult in the current age because the best and most obvious ideas are quickly discovered and the remaining ideas are less novel or groundbreaking. The second theory is that there are diminishing returns to investment in research labor – more researchers decrease the number of innovations per worker due to duplicated efforts.
But Knott does have another explanation, which is that companies may have become worse at R&D.
Knott researched the financial data of all publicly traded U.S. firms for the past 40 years and found patterns related to industry technological advancements that reflect already evident disruptions – for example, the replacement of typewriters by computers. Knott’s conclusion from her in-depth research is that companies are experiencing less growth from R&D efforts because they are worse at innovating, not because innovation has gotten harder.
But it’s not all doom and gloom. What Knott identified using RQ is that companies aren’t necessarily fated when an industry declines or is disrupted; they often find opportunities elsewhere by diversifying.
Knott claims that “if the top 20 firms traded on U.S. exchanges had optimized their 2010 R&D spending using the RQ method, the collective increase in market cap would have been an astonishing $1 trillion.”
Part of that optimization uses RQ to leverage the potential longer-term benefits. According to Knott, “RQ also allows companies to link changes in R&D strategy, practices, and processes more closely to profitability and value.”
Allocating Resources to Core, Adjacent, and Transformational Initiatives
Nagji and Tuff, referenced above, offer solutions on better optimizing R&D portfolios. The team conducted research on the industrial, technology, and consumer goods sectors that showed a pattern whereby the allocation of resources across core, adjacent, and transformational initiatives correlated with significantly better performance that was reflected in a firm’s share price.
According to Nagji and Tuff, “companies that allocated about 70 percent of their innovation activity to core initiatives, 20 percent to adjacent ones, and 10 percent to transformational ones outperformed their peers, typically realizing a P/E premium of 10 percent to 20 percent.”
While each company will look for a different balance depending on their risk profile, the authors stated that Google strives for a 70-20-10 balance and estimates that the 10 percent allocated to transformational efforts are responsible for the company’s new offerings.
Nagji and Tuff state that a company that seeks to catch up with industry leaders might choose a more risky, transformational portfolio. A company that is already dominant may decide to reduce its risk and concentrate on core initiatives, not transformational ones.
M&A and Acquiring as a New Form of R&D
The trend in M&A of acquiring high-tech startups has become a popular strategy for supplementing or mimicing traditional R&D.
According to the Foundation, the number of technology-based startups in the U.S. economy grew almost 50 percent in the last ten years. Moreover, VC-backed startups grew employment and sales 40 percent faster than non-VC-backed startups on
A panel of venture startup founders including Garrett discussed corporate innovation and investment with Paresh Dave of the LA Times. According to Matt Garratt of Salesforce, it’s not just tech companies that are involved. Of the total number of tech acquisitions in 2016, Garratt says “around half were from non-tech buyers.”
The panelists noted that corporates who do invest and acquire tech startups are unfamiliar with the process and concepts such as “deal flow, diversifying bets, and portfolio company growth.”

Best Practices for R&D
Based on Nahji and Tuff’s research and a case study analysis of Amazon and Google outlined in the previous article, “Research and Development – Who Does it Well and How,” we summarize some best practices of these market leaders.
Articulate a clear R&D ambition (Nagji and Tuff, 2012).
Balance core and transformational ventures (Nagji and Tuff, 2012).
Use technology throughout an organization, not just as part of partitioned R&D activities (Bezos, 1997).
Recognize core competencies and maximize them (Bezos, 1997).
Balance risk and potential breakthrough goals with investor and stakeholder tolerance (Nagji and Tuff, 2012).
Develop a cut-throat portfolio selection strategy (Google X, 2016).
This dive into the R&D landscape has highlighted some best practices that companies can use toward a better strategy for their R&D efforts. Whether the decision is to pursue transformational innovation and the next breakthrough or to focus on broad learning through acquiring or strategic M&As, we hope we’ve offered some valuable data and insights.

A Better Approach to Talent Acquisition
Take a moment to survey the talent landscape, because it has changed. Skills aren’t quite as easy to come by, and workers are switching employers to gain experience. According to a recent Gallup poll, 60 percent of the younger generation is open to new job opportunities, which implies that job hopping is a trend. Companies must attract the right talent now, and then hold onto it.
The figure below, from Deloitte, highlights the changes that have occurred in HRM and emphasizes how the rules have changed for talent acquisition. The employee’s needs and opinions are now the focus, not those of the employer.

But before you decide to transform your talent acquisition processes, consider the impact of the changing landscape on your organizational ecosystem. Assess what infrastructure and talent you need now to meet the demands of better hiring for the future.
Develop a plan for incremental change in HR processes or a complete make-over if that’s what you need. If the latter is the case, it might be a good idea to bring in outside consultants who have experience with operations similar to your own to help determine the level of change your talent acquisition group needs and how to integrate other HR functions.
Finally, consider how functional your current HR systems are. Could you benefit from solutions that manage the basic, time-consuming tasks such as sourcing candidates? Is your HR ecosystem equipped to build emotional connections with candidates and strengthen your brand as an employer? This is what you should emphasize.
From Talent Seeker to Talent Magnet
Digital transformation has brought new rhetoric with myriad buzzwords: embedded talent acquisition, modular recruitment software, right sourcing, and data-driven recruitment are all good examples. But, refreshingly, the age-old recipe for talent acquisition will not steer you wrong: attract the right candidate at the right time, at the right price, with the right motivation.
The phrase “attracting” and not “finding” is key to transcending from a Talent Seeker to a Talent Magnet, which is required if the goal is to acquire competitive human capital for innovation. No less important are employment branding and developing candidate experience initiatives.
Employment Branding to Proactively Attract Talent
Applicants research companies as voraciously as companies research applicants. Employer branding is crucial so that potential candidates have a good impression of an employer from job sites such as Glassdoor.com and company websites. Your company website should be mobile-enabled, host a dynamic career page, and the content should be easy to read with minimal scrolling – even better, use micro videos.
Mobile users favor videos because a huge amount of information can be transmitted in two minutes. Companies should include subjects that might interest potential recruits and answer questions they might have about the company culture and mission. For example, include introductions to key projects, staff bios, or a tour of R&D or operational premises. These examples provided by Colin Hogan, contributor to Video Brewery, include videos from Starbucks, Shopify, and Dropbox.
“Ideas and solutions are centered around cognitive technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine-to-machine learning, robotic process automation, natural language processing, predictive algorithms, and self-learning. Chatbots are becoming popular, including the recently launched Olivia, which guides candidates through an application process with sequenced questions.”
— Vartul Mittal, Global Business Transformation & Automation Leader, ATC Events & Media, 2016
How you look as an employer is down to your brand strategy. Potential applicants don’t hesitate to Google your reviews on job sites and even reach out on social media for feedback from current or old employees.
A side effect of the digital era with its penchant for social media platforms, employer review sites, and chat rooms is that companies are transparent to potential employees. This is great for employees but, depending on a company’s brand status, this can be either a benefit or a disadvantage to employers. Employment branding can amount to a PR campaign or disaster management, but it’s essential to build and preserve your reputation.
“We’re all aware of the advancing technologies and shifting corporate trends, and with this evolution brings more transparency making your company a glass house to candidates.”

Highlight corporate social responsibility activities on your website along with the benefits of working for your organization. Post introductory micro-videos of your employees on your website and social media pages. It gives a personal touch and shows your workplace culture. Respond positively and assertively to any negative reviews that may appear on career pages.
It’s crucial to continuously manage your brand to mitigate any damage to your reputation. No matter how great your culture, there are always disgruntled employees. Any negative feedback should be dealt with promptly to minimize its impact and to show that the company is concerned with employees’ experiences. A negative posting on Facebook, for example, should address the poster’s concerns without being defensive.
For expert recruitment, many companies rely on their networks and word of mouth. That way, potential applicants come with a trusted recommendation. Developing a long-term partnership with a recruitment consultant means that a company’s needs are understood.
Good recruiters also maintain long-term relationships with their job search clients, even when they are gainfully employed. The best talent is typically not looking for a job, but a professional recruiter might be able to recognize a niche position and tempt the best person to consider a move.
Talent acquisition is a costly, ongoing endeavor. But in the same way that transforming a weather-beaten house into a fresh, modern, IoT-equipped dwelling is no easy feat, knowing the hidden costs up front, and fixing the underlying problems, will create a stronger structure. That stronger structure will be better able to attract and retain talent, because it is more modern, ready to respond to technology advancements, and prepped for the future.
How Big Data Tools Can Improve the Candidate Experience
There are two takeaways here: the need to prioritize the candidate experience and use big data and digital tools to streamline hiring.
The candidate experience is crucial, and it should be one that is convenient, fast, impressionable, and relationship-oriented. Employers need to maintain an open dialogue with candidates and provide them with information. Information is always a Google Search away, so keeping candidates informed of their application status keeps your company top of mind and satisfies the candidate’s thirst for feedback.
According to Siofra Pratt, contributor to Social talent, a company that does not have a mobile-enabled career site could miss 50 percent of potential candidates. Also, if applicants cannot apply using a mobile site, a company could lose up to 50 percent of applications they otherwise might have received if there had been a mobile application option.
These rapid, digital applications often do not require the submission of a resume. No longer the be-all and end-all of the application process, Wanda Thibodeaux, contributor to Inc. reports that companies such as Unilever are replacing resume digital scanning tools with internet and social media aggregation software. These solutions scan the internet and social platforms to determine the skills, background, social circles, and organizational involvements of applicants to determine their suitability. Resumes are becoming defunct.
Candidates also want an easy application process, confirmation that they are being considered or not –  and they want answers to their questions quickly.
“Applicants to SAP receive an assessment report that tells them whether they are the right fit for the role. The candidate reaction is, ‘Wow! I’ve had instant feedback.’ Even with a rejection, it is better than sitting on a database hoping a recruiter will call in six months’ time.”
— Matthew Jeffery, VP and Head of Global Sourcing and Employer Branding at SAP, 2016
Cognitive recruiting is a hiring method that applies new technologies and solutions to build relationships. For example, Chatbots such as Olivia guide candidates through the application process. Gamification draws in applicants by prompting them to take tests or quizzes. The interaction makes the application process more enjoyable for the candidate and more productive for the employer who can analyze the results and compare them against a job skills profile.
Traditional applicant tracking systems are being replaced by data analytics that can identify passive candidates who, if approached, might be likely to consider an opportunity. Predictive analytics help to prioritize workflow, conduct pre-hire analyses, and assess the quality of hires.
Aggregation tools using big data and artificial intelligence could become the most popular screening method. For example, video interviews with the application of AI can identify promising candidates and replace traditional interviews, saving money and reducing time to hire.
As digital solutions take over much of the rote sourcing and sorting, HR professionals can concentrate on building psychological and emotional connections with applicants – something that software can’t yet do. These relationships are important for both parties to feel certain that the right candidate is being selected.
But here’s the bad news.
As the application process has become quicker and easier, the volume of applications has increased. According to a report by Michael Stephan, David Brown, Robin Erickson, human capital consultants for Deloitte, there has been an exponential increase in the volume of applications through sourcing channels, which has been detrimental to hiring effectiveness.
Candidates apply to roles that may not be exactly what they want because they can do so with just a few clicks or taps. Consequently, the recruiter is spending inordinate amounts of time sifting through applications. According to a survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, close to 75 percent of employers surveyed said they had seen an increase in the number of applications from candidates who are not equipped to perform in the advertised role.
One way to combat applicant volume is to administer various tests to candidates during the hiring process, to increase the likelihood of a good hire. The graphic below is provided by the Harvard Business Review and is based on data from Frank L.Schmidt. The graph shows which tests are better predictors of future job performance.

An algorithm scans those applications, 275,500 so far…The software weeds out more than half of the pool.”
— Joelle Hutcheon, Spokeswoman, Unilever
Here’s a guide to digital screening tools that can mitigate the problem of applicant volume and help identify the “best from the rest.”
Suitability Tools: Algorithm-based tools can take care of the first level of screening. They are optimized to assess candidate suitability based on requirements such as education, location, years of experience, and capabilities.
Elimination Tools: Elimination tools narrow down the pack by rejecting those least likely to be hired. Recruiters can then focus on the remaining candidates and factors such as cultural fit. Henri de Romrée, Bruce Fecheyr-Lippens, and Bill Schaninger, partners at McKinsey, claim that this step in the hiring process provides a 500 percent return on investment.
Commitment Hurdles: These are typically try-out activities, such as a skills test of some sort, included as a compulsory component in the application process. The tests determine the commitment and interest level of candidates early on, so that time and resources are not wasted in interviews.
“At Zulily, candidates for software engineering positions are given a take-home test to assess their ability to write code, merchandising candidates are required to pass a retail math test, demonstrating that they have a basic understanding of arithmetic … Analytics assessments are given to candidates vying for some jobs in marketing and operations.”
— Bill French, Head of Talent Acquisition, Zulily
It’s not uncommon for applicants to embellish their resumes, which can undermine screening tools and increase the work of the recruiter. John Bateson, Jochen Wirtz, Eugene Burke, and Carly Vaughan, contributors to The Harvard Business Review, state that a “test first” approach can eliminate 50 percent of applicants who are not up to the job, despite what they claim on paper. The authors note that companies in sectors such as retail or security can cut costs and save resources for the later, costlier interview process.
Competence tools that use artificial intelligence decide whether a candidate moves on to the next stage, and candidates who fail to perform well in the tests are automatically removed from the process.
“Unilever is using digital gamification for agile screening of graduate applications. Previously, recruiters screened six candidates to put one through the screening process; now recruiters are screening two candidates to put one through all four steps. ”
— Michael Stephan, David Brown, Robin Erickson, Human capital consultants Deloitte, 2017.
Each of the above technologies complements a stage in the hiring/recruitment funnel. The technologies are invaluable for whittling down the number of applications but, as the candidate pool shrinks, a human touch is required. The figure below, provided by Deloitte, shows the recruitment process from attracting candidates to onboarding.

The Human Touch – Sealing the Deal
Shortlisting is where the first real “human” activity should occur. Recruiters and talent specialists need to physically view the machine-selected applications and make decisions on who to interview.
Losing a potential candidate at the offer stage is a blow but not uncommon. From the candidate’s perspective, if multiple offers are received, the employer that provided the best candidate experience and made the offer that most closely meets their needs will most likely be the lucky one.
The screening and interview experience should be easy and convenient to seal the deal. It pays to find out what motivates a selected candidate by asking the right questions during the interview and then offering them something as close as possible.
An employer of choice is one that offers a positive, unique, and exciting proposition that meets the needs of the candidate. An employer might be limited in terms of resources, but it might be able to offer mentorships or skills development that the employee is looking for but won’t find with another employer.
Unilever is a model case study for employee-centric IT talent acquisition. Rather than visit college campuses to recruit, the firm places targeted advertisements on Facebook and popular career sites like WayUp and the Muse. From there, interested candidates apply for entry-level jobs and internships in just a few clicks.
Unilever’s HR solutions pull information from the candidates’ LinkedIn profiles, an algorithm scans applications, weeding out over 50 percent, and humans take it from there.
Gamification, a strategy to engage applicants, is integrated into the entry-level recruitment process, and candidates are asked to play games to assess their concentration skills. Short-listed applicants submit videos of behavioral interviews on HireVue through a website or app. Artificial intelligence filters up to 80 percent of these candidates using data points such as how quickly they respond to questions, their facial expressions, and vocabulary. Depending on their responses, more candidates are weeded out according to their potential for success with the company.
The final step is the first time an algorithm is not involved –  the in-person interview with HR managers and executives. The whole process is an easy and enjoyable one for the applicant. It is revolutionary, convenient, and effective.
Kelsey Gee, contributor to Fox Business, reports that hiring is faster and better for Unilever. Eighty percent of final-round candidates receive a job offer; the same percentage accepts. The company saves on recruiting costs although exact numbers have not been disclosed. How’s that for building a reputation and branding?
The Initial Candidate Conversation
An increasing number of first-round interviews are being conducted remotely and using communication platforms such as Skype, Google Hangouts, and FaceTime. Also, one-way interview videos are being submitted by applicants for later viewing by interviewers.
However, only a human can read between the lines of candidate responses. It’s important then, when developing interview questions, to think about the precise information you need to feel confident that the candidate is a good fit.
For example, does a candidate pause when asked why the job appeals to them? What do the facial expressions of the candidate reveal? Most communication is nonverbal, and only a human can interpret visual cues.
The CLAMPS (Challenge, Location, Advancement, Money, People, Security) model, provided by The Hill Group, a U.K.-based executive search company, can reveal the motivations behind a candidate’s application. The model considers how the candidate ranks certain work factors according to their motivational significance.
The debate lingers as to whether structured or unstructured interviews can better predict a candidate’s suitability. The structured interview is highly prescribed by behavioral specialists yet fiercely resisted by hiring managers, partly because the consensus is that building rapport with candidates is difficult through this type of interview. Identifying what the person can do in comparison to others can be achieved through structured questioning, but finding out who they really are is difficult.
Structured questioning might be a better choice for technical jobs where specific skills are crucial, while unstructured questions might give a creative person more of a chance to shine. However, unstructured interviews carry the risk that interviewer bias will affect decisions. It’s human nature for people to be drawn to those who remind them of themselves, which is an emotional reaction rather than a rational one and not conducive to creating a diverse and innovative workforce.
Again, rapport is important because the candidate is assessing the interviewers as much as they are assessing the candidate. The interview, ideally, should be an impressionable experience for the candidate. It is the main opportunity for the employer to lure the candidate in and convince them that they will be a good fit; it is also the prime opportunity for the candidate to feel assured that they will make the right decision if they receive an offer.
Incorporating both structured and unstructured techniques during the interview is an option.  Following a scientific format coupled with scenario-based questions and social assessment techniques is a good balance, although each company is unique and should experiment with techniques and measure the results.
Job Profiling and Candidate Personality Traits
Social media and job sites mean that corporate interview questions are available – and predictable as a result. Candidates today can excel at interviewing if they do the legwork. They know that they should appear motivated and energetic, and they are asked the same routine questions in similar interview circumstances.
Therefore, job profiling should coincide with corresponding personality trait testing if constraints allow, which is harder for candidates to manipulate. By verifying a personality fit by testing against job requirements, the screening process becomes more targeted.
Suggested questions to identify personality traits are available with a simple Google search, and the adapted version of the Big Five Personality Traits Model comes highly recommended by talent experts, as do DiSC, Myers-Briggs, and StrengthsFinder.
“Candidates now routinely prepare and video their practice interviews to the point where their responses are universally impressive, if not genuine or accurate.”
— John Sullivan, HR Thought Leader, HBR
The strategies suggested in this article highlight the multitude of factors that go into the hiring experience. Firms won’t be able to implement every single method, so it’s important to stay flexible and find out what works for each unique situation. Keep an ear to the ground and borrow (steal) techniques from companies on the cutting edge of the hiring process.
The software platforms of pioneering companies have perfected candidate experience campaigns; Deloitte, Domino’s Pizza, Formaposte, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, Google, McDonald’s, Unilever, and Zappos are all case studies to explore. The approach of these companies reduces hidden recruitment costs by minimizing vacancy costs. Ongoing branding and outreach combined with gamification and easy job application ensure a stream of incoming talent.
As with any experience design, the process should be flexible and focused on long-term outcomes. Don’t run the 100-yard sprint to secure exceptional candidates – run the marathon of continuously bringing aboard top talent for innovation in your organization.
The Hidden Costs of Bad Hiring
It’s rarely the acquisition of an old house alone that creates financial hardship; more problematic are the trickle-down effects of existing problems that were never resolved. Leaky pipes, faulty wiring, drafty windows, and old appliances can all be devastating financially for the unsuspecting home owner. Building a strong basic structure free of underlying problems that can go undetected is also the responsibility of talent acquisition professionals. And, as with the acquisition of real estate, there are hidden costs to talent acquisition, which are almost never taken into consideration.
Innovation requires a strong workforce built with sensible methods such as effective marketing, targeted interviewing and, most importantly, a focus on the employee. But many companies make the mistake of hiring the wrong person, which is the number one hidden expense when it comes to talent acquisition and retention.
The hiring process includes interview expenses such as travel, hotel, and meals; training and orientation; and employment testing and screening. Then, if the wrong employee is hired and subsequently leaves, there are termination costs, such as temporary health care coverage or COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act), and, in the worst case, potential litigation expenses.
If an unhappy employee stays, the costs can be even higher. According A.J. Agrawal, contributor to the Huffington Post, dissatisfied employees cost companies billions of dollars, sometimes sending them into bankruptcy. Decreased productivity, more careless accidents, and damage to brand reputation because of poor customer service are all symptoms of poor morale and worker discontent.
The real cost of open vacancies is another hidden cause of financial drain with a tremendous impact on profit. What’s more, it often eludes most organizational cost centers. The combined quantifiable cost of every unfilled position in the organization is no less impactful on the bottom line.
The DHI-DFH Mean Vacancy Duration measure which is provided by DHI Group, Inc. and Dr. Steven Davis, Professor of International Business and Economics at the University of Chicago, found the average job vacancy duration of professional and business services jobs to be 26.1 working days in 2016. In May, technology jobs remained open for 25.6 working days.
The figure below shows how to calculate the cost of vacant positions.

The Trickle-down Effects of Bad Hires
Beyond hidden costs, trickle-down effects of poor talent acquisition could be even more lethal to a business. High turnover can result in low morale, lost customers due to unsatisfactory service, lost sales, reduced product quality, and low production. Colleagues disrupted by turnover must shoulder the additional workload, and an environment where employees come and go is not a healthy one for innovation.
Drake International’s calculator will help you to determine the costs of “hiring wrong” for your organization. (Drake International, Video.) The calculation is based on benchmarking the cost of the employee (salary and benefits), the cost of other employees having to fill in while the position is vacant, the cost of filling the vacancy (hiring manager expenses, moving expenses, advertising and background check costs) onboarding costs, and productivity ramp-up.
Here is a summary of some of the trickle-down effects of having vacant positions, including those affecting management, team cohesiveness, and real costs, according to a white paper by the Ropella Group.
Personnel costs: a six-month loss on an average manager’s contribution could cost $300K due to poor quality work because workers are stretched thin, there are increased errors, higher turnover, and less creativity.
Teams suffer in terms of cohesiveness and time-to-productivity if a team leader position is lost.
Real costs include delayed time to market, underused equipment, and decreased output.
Management costs: there is a multiplier effect on productivity, recruitment, and worker frustration due to lack of support.
Customer costs: there are fewer sales, customer attrition because of delayed products, and poor customer service.
Competitive advantage costs: analysts consider the company weak, competitors consider the company vulnerable, and potential employees consider the company to be at risk of failure.",5099

Author’s Note
This beginning of this article is different from all other HowDo content.
I would have loved to have started with a step-by step guide on Building a Corporate Culture that is similar to HowDo’s other guides. However, I struggle with corporate culture “best practice”, as those practices have created the systemic inequality that is the foundation of our current society and economy. This foundation needs to evolve. Therefore, best practice in corporate culture needs to evolve. Quickly.
Culture is hugely important when it comes to innovation. Unfortunately, corporate culture as a tool to building better companies is currently just theater. There is such inequality in society and corporate hierarchies that a discussion about corporate culture seems indulgent and ridiculous. A discussion on improving creativity, teamwork, and morale among workers requires long-term strategy. CEOs of large companies are often threatened with their jobs if they pursue a long-term strategies. The CEO’s bosses – shareholders – prefer short-term tactics that ensure dividends and buybacks. Until we fix the root cause of culture failure (short-term focus on shareholder value), any action to improve culture is merely posturing.
I believe that we have come to a point where the American worker is a commodity. Few are valued, and most are cast aside when necessary because there are plenty more available where that came from. The misery is evident throughout the social strata; from factory floor workers who are forced to accept abysmal working conditions, teachers who must moonlight as Uber drivers, to cardiac-prone executives who think that meeting quarterly earnings is worth an 80-hour week and the plushest corner office. 
Assuming that a company is seeking to create and to build a culture of living wages, I suggest five basic principles: 
Pay staff a living wage
Show respect
Value diversity and inclusion
Use data
Be customer-obsessed
That’s it. It’s not rocket science, and it should be intuitive. But the problem is that investors control the companies, which means that near-term profits rule over long-term evolution. Of course, a certain culture can improve profits, but it’s usually at the cost of something that people consider more important, such as their health, happiness, time with family and the foundation of the community and environment around them. Thus, such cultures are not sustainable over the long term.
Amazon developed a culture that assured them unbelievable success. But even for Amazon, the chicken’s are starting to come home to roost.
Click on “About Us,” on Amazon’s website, and here’s what you’ll see”
“Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.”
Amazon is driven by the bottom line, as are all corporate enterprises, and it has been revolutionary in its efforts. But this power comes at what cost to its workers? Amazon’s vice president of cloud computing, Tim Bray, in May 2020, stated that “Amazon treats the humans in the warehouses as fungible units of pick-and-pack potential.” He resigned after witnessing the firing of whistleblowers who were exposing the fear of warehouse employees working under the threat of COVID-19. 
Thus, to underscore my earlier point. Until corporate America is in a healthier place and not purely driven by profits, a discussion on culture can only be about exploitation.
How It All Went Wrong
When Patty McCord wrote Netflix’s culture deck “Freedom & Responsibility”, she cemented in the minds of Silicon Valley executives that technology companies have to be inherently staffed by the best for their needs at the time. According to McCord:
“Adequate performance gets a generous severance package. We’re a team, not a family. We’re like a pro sports team, not a kid’s recreational team. Netflix leaders hire, develop, and cut smartly, so we have stars in every position.”
— Patty McCord
McCord and Netflix managers use what they call the “Keeper Test” where they ask: “Which of my people, if they told me they were leaving for a similar job at a peer company, would I fight hard to keep at Netflix?” Those that don’t make the list get generous severance packages to make room for a perfect fit for the role.
Netflix is like the NBA, and NBA players who aren’t the best are let go. I experienced the Netfflix culture firsthand. I interviewed with Netflix, and I even got the job as Director of Innovation. My last round of interviews was with Patty McCord, and she began the interview by saying rather dramatically that she had just come from letting seven people go.
“Oh my God, that’s terrible,” I responded. “I’m so sorry. Was the team not doing well?” 
“No. Our needs changed.” she said, abruptly. 
“Well, why not just retrain them?” I asked.
“Because we can’t retrain them fast enough. It’s faster just to hire someone who knows what we need now.”
I turned down the job to stay at PayPal.
Sheryl Sandberg, the COO of Facebook, said that Patty McCord’s culture deck was the most important thing to come out of Silicon Valley. In the ensuing months, 13 million people read that culture deck. The deck, unintentionally, pointed to a homogenous workforce filled with the best that the millennial Harvard-MIT elite could muster. It changed everything, and all of Silicon Valley agreed that its tech companies should be filled exclusively with top performers. Around the same time, 2011, Walter Isaccson’s biography on Steve Jobs was released. This book gave permission for all Steve Jobs wannabes in Silicon Valley to become raging assholes overnight. And so the culture of homogenized tech was born.
As we look at the future, the gig economy is front and center for most jobs and for most job categories. That’s only going to grow. And, in the meantime, technology is getting more complicated; that is, if you’re an actual technologist. Emerging technology companies with real potential are few and far between. So, the salaries, the benefits, the stocks, all those things that go along with a high-performance culture are becoming more and more polarized among demographics, among geographies, among teams, among companies. 
Take Amazon as an example. The office culture of the warehouse is very different from the office culture of the machine learning teams. The machine learning teams have different cultures across the different disciplines of machine learning and the various categories or services or products to which machine learning is being applied. If you have a team of MBAs, the culture will be dramatically different then if you have a team that didn’t graduate high school. Education changes the culture, geography changes the culture, everything changes the culture.
The Complexities of Corporate Culture
Corporate culture is plagued by two clearly opposing forces. One is the brute force reality of the current market that demands high-level operations at all times; otherwise, you fall behind. Many companies are buoyed by great cultures now, but they are not going to survive when up against the Amazons of the world. In 1964, the average tenure of companies on the S&P 500 was 33 years. In 2016, the average was 24 years, and it is forecast to shrink to just 12 years by 2027, according to Innosight’s biennial corporate longevity forecast.
But the second force is that great cultures are possible, and they have led to incredible breakthroughs. While the cultures of Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, and Microsoft are easy to criticize, their success in terms of corporate evolution cannot be denied.
If a company has a successful culture today, I would wager that there are one of three things going on. The first is that it could be a monopoly. In this case, the company has past maturity, and is slowly on the decline while trying to extract as much money for Wall Street and CEOs as possible. There is enough cash to go round, and no one is rocking the boat—for now, culturally, things are stable.
The second thing that could be the case is that the company is a super early-stage startup financed by sociopaths who don’t care about employee well-being or the well-being of the product. The financiers are in it to make their [LPs] happy so that they can raise more money and get more fees. Startups have great cultures. Everyone working there is on an equal footing because nobody knows what they are doing. The whole team pitches in and gives their best intensively, often to a good end. However, 90 percent of startups fail. 
The third scenario for a great culture could be found in a niche boutique retailer, or a small brand with a high degree of specialization and differentiation. In other words, there is a unique selling product with a defensible market position. 
Why do these three scenarios work culture-wise? The reason is that none of these scenarios involve the need for hyper-performance. The need for hyper-performance, or scaling, changes the stress associated with the functioning of the teams. When a company grows to a certain point, people start to experience imbalance in their lives.
The Work-Life Balance Myth
Many Silicon Valley companies go to great lengths to ensure hyper-performance from their employees. Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Cleary Gottlieb and Kirkland & Ellis, Unilever, Deloitte, Uber, LinkedIn, Intel, Ebay, Yahoo, Netflix, Salesforce, Spotify, Time Warner, and Snapchat all offer oocyte cryopreservation—egg freezing—to their female executives. Disguised as the ultimate perk, it merely extends the productivity horizon and shelf life of their female performers. In the meantime, all employees, egg incubators or no, are expected to give their all, sacrifice time with loved ones, and cast aside their own mental states for the pursuit of profits. This is the work-balance myth.
It’s a well-documented phenomenon that the video game industry constantly uses people until they’re burnt out and they disappear, both on the supply and the demand side. But it’s such an attractive industry because it’s fun, trendy, carries prestige, and there’s lots of money and perks. 
The companies that are perceived to have good cultures are filled by type-A personalities who are willing to forgo normal life. They also tend to be young and full of optimism. How many 65-year-old product managers do you see? VPs of products? These people quickly move out of the sector. I did.
My experience as an innovation and product manager was not something I care to repeat. I wish I had been better equipped to deal with corporate culture. I had to make really tough decisions on the spot with my team. I lost so much sleep. I gained so much weight. I needed therapy sessions and had emotional breakdowns because I cared deeply about the people I was trying to manage. Some of whom were not the right fit, some were outrageous assholes, and some were just the best people I’ve ever met in my entire life, and I’m friends with them until this day.
I was trying to relate to people who were just trying to protect their jobs and who knew I could take that job away. Meanwhile I was trying to achieve the goals set by executives who were waiting for a good reason to snipe my team’s paychecks. I had to justify all of these things all the time. It was impossible to balance and emotionally punishing.
Corporate culture is glamorized. The stories where teams are flown to cool exotic locations may look like opulence, and sometimes they are—WeWork was a great example of ridiculous excess for a product that didn’t need to exist. But what people miss is that these stunts are moves of desperation because their teams are on the verge of quitting. 
Every time I’ve resorted to a morale-building splurge for my team, it’s because they’re burnt out, and if I hadn’t done something they would have found a better job; one with less stress and more meaning. Because once you get in the middle of that stress, there’s absolutely nothing that you want to do other than escape that stress.
I’ve been in meetings where executives have staunchly advocated to find a location for operations where there is no union. Let’s not deal with collective bargaining rights, workers’ rights, healthcare, the law, OSHA safety precautions, reasonable working hours, or the ability to take time off. Basically, these companies don’t want to deal with the fact that they have to employ people. 
These companies are not investing in the future; they are investing in themselves. That’s why stock buy-backs are at an all-time high, because the culture of executives is that they should give themselves as big a bonus as possible based on the most reliable way of paying Wall Street.
Wall Street’s Trickle Down
Wall Street expectations are around 7% growth annually. Most companies can’t grow their revenue at 7%, so they boost their value to remain attractive to investors by buying back their stock. Supposedly, this is also a sign of confidence and an indicator that management considers growth to be imminent. That’s the culture of Wall Street. That’s the culture of the CEOs. Meanwhile, Wall Street and investors hold all the strings and the livelihoods of the board and the executives.
So, if we are to stop our gradual economic decline and build a culture where employees are moderately comfortable, adequately educated, not living in food deserts, and able to earnestly focus on a vocation, Wall Street must stop taking the money of corporations, and CEOs must stop lying to their employees and claiming to nurture a culture for the future.
Venture capitalists are much the same as Wall Street investors. A startup’s mission will end at the first round if they are not doing well. No profit? Your asset will be up for sale, and you will get nothing. Only a fraction of companies, perhaps 5% of companies who start, might receive venture capital. Ninety-seven percent of those fail. Only 60% of the investments will succeed. With a 60% failure rate, investors are not going to invest equally among all of them; they have to prioritize among those that have the highest probability for return.
A startup culture might be great at the beginning and in the first couple of years, but it will all turn to nought unless it is a stellar standout. But as that startup scales, it will follow the path of most success stories. If you are an executive at the top, you’re golden, but if you’re a warehouse worker at the bottom, you’re screwed.
So, to discuss internal culture as a way to innovate is merely posturing. The reality is that executives, most often the COO, CFO, CEO, and CTO, are all incentivized by Wall Street. They are concerned only with short-term profits, which is not conducive to a culture of evolution. Until that changes, the decline in corporate culture will continue. While workers are so desperate that they must accept whatever they can get, a discussion on corporate culture seems ridiculous. Either we make more, better companies, or we just need to admit that culture is a moot point.
To get anywhere, we must fix the culture of companies and help companies actually grow—grow under their own weight, grow with their teams, grow with the life around them, grow within their communities, and help their communities to grow. “Help families in need” is the only cultural pillar that really makes sense for every company, but we’re far from that. 
Change the Incentives, Change the System
The answer, in my opinion, is to build better companies that don’t need external capital, that solve real market problems, that have long-term strategies with long-term capital plans and capital allocation. Such companies will be solid and possess the potential to evolve and contribute value.
Foundationally, that takes changing the incentive system.
Right now, a very small number of people get rich and everyone else gets the crumbs. We have to change the paradigm. If the incentives change, culture will adjust and become bespoke to the solution. 
Muller’s Ratchet and Diversity
Paying workers a living wage and respect are two pillars of culture that shouldn’t require explanation. Valuing diversity is equally valuable and essential to evolution.
Muller’s ratchet describes a process whereby a biome is exclusively reproducing asexually and inherently producing more flaws. Even in asexual creatures, the offspring that have the highest probability of survival are those that are genetically different, not those that are genetically similar. In sexual reproduction, that’s the whole point. You mix the DNA of two individuals, and you produce something that is de-risked for the future.
If we try to build culture around a group of homogenous Harvard Business School graduates or McKinsey models, we are inherently predisposing the future to bias. What we should be doing is trying to solve problems in real time with diverse individuals who deserve to be on a team. And the work must be done in an environment where there is respect, tolerance, understanding, diversity, inclusion, cultural sensitivity, and communication. 
In conclusion, I would go so far as to say that culture is the absence of something more than it is the presence of something. It is the absence of a manager who threatens you if you don’t perform as expected, it is the absence of worry that you must make decisions based on the need for short-term profit. It is the absence of the need to please shareholders rather than optimize the potential of what you have.
Change is upon us in so many ways, and I hope the time will come when culture can truly be the engine for creative and evolutionary companies, not just Wall Street.

Corporate Culture: the Research So Far
Because culture is such an important topic and a critical component of companies’ machinations today, I realize that it should not be dismissed. The following is a collection of the data, theories, and knowledge that I have gathered over the years before the economic and social context took a turn for the worse. I would like to tell you that I have the answers and the tools. But all I can suggest is that we start a conversation that includes the data and information that I present. 
In that regard, I welcome your opinions and experiences as readers to build a forum upon which we might find a better way. 
How Big a Factor Is Culture in Firm Performance?
Scholarly interest in the impact of culture on organizations is well documented. In 1992, Harvard Business School Professors John P. Kotter and James L. Heskett studied the corporate cultures of 200 companies and how each company’s culture affected their long-term economic performance.
The researchers also wrote a book chronicling their findings called, “Corporate Culture and Performance,” which concluded that strong corporate cultures with strong financial results “highly value employees, customers, and owners, and that those cultures encourage leadership from everyone in the firm.” Firms that were studied include Hewlett-Packard, Xerox, ICI, Nissan, and First Chicago.
In strong corporate cultures, if customers demand a change, say Kotter and Heskett, “the organization’s culture is such that people are forced to change their practices to meet the new needs. Also, anyone within the organization is empowered to do so.”
The table below is extracted from the book. It shows the difference in performance for 12 companies with a performance-enhancing culture and 20 without a performance-enhancing culture in areas such as revenue and stock price. The differences are staggering.

What Defines Corporate Culture?
Corporate culture is the summation of all the interactions that make up a company. Think of it as a family. Some families are loud, members speak their mind without holding back, and frequent conflicts are common. Other families are quiet, they communicate as little as possible, and conflicts are avoided at all costs. It’s very difficult to make a quiet family act like a loud family, it’s against their nature and all they hold dear. It’s also very hard to change an established corporate culture.
Kotter and Heskett refer to a “performance-enhancing culture,” which they describe as one that highly values employees, customers, and owners and empowers all of its employees to become leaders. Steve Blank, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, author, and professor, uses the term “innovation culture,” which is “a large company with a unified purpose that can move with speed, agility, and passion.” 
Ex-Netflix chief talent officer Patty Mccord defines culture as:
“the stories people tell. It’s the way people operate when no one’s looking. It’s the values that you hold dear, that you know your colleagues do [as well]. It’s the expectations of how people are going to behave, and what gets punished and what gets rewarded.”
— Patty McCord
A firm’s culture defines to what extent it serves the customer well, is doing what it is capable of, and is cognizant of its competition. A fair assessment of a corporate culture can identify gaps and show ways to manage that competition bearing in mind the macro trends in the business and natural environment. 
As Amazon has shown, embedding a culture is a huge component of business strategy. Culture will affect your company’s approach to the market; the how, when, and why of actions. If actions become second nature by becoming culturally ingrained, everyone involved with that culture does the “right thing” instinctively. Culture is powerful.
Many will agree that culture is the primary barrier when shifting from a traditional organization to a learning organization. The transition requires adopting new norms and letting go of old ones, something that is difficult and uncomfortable.
Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, knows that if the culture is right, problems in the business process can be quickly solved. If the culture is wrong, the opposite is the case. That’s why Amazon places such emphasis on its customer-first and data-driven culture. Both of these cultural pillars are crucial.
Why Is Culture The Reason That Innovation Often Fails?
Culture, not processes, are the reason that most businesses fail. In a startup, under a “lean” model, small teams work independently and quickly to solve problems. This works for a startup where everyone on the team is in the same boat and working together intensely toward the same goal. The culture works.
But what happens when the startup grows, scales, is acquired, or joins a larger corporation. The added stress changes the culture. First, not everyone can be on the “cool” team, and jealousy rears its ugly head. Second, the cool team threatens to change the way the company works, which creates uncertainty and fear. You can’t suddenly change the way a warehouse functions, for example. There are protocols to follow, safety rules, processes set in stone.
Thus, there are almost two extremes in business culture—there is either continuous change and evolution at a consistent pace, such as a startup or an anomaly like Amazon—or the culture is static. Most businesses are in the static world. If you have something that is moving fast and breaking under the lean process, and you try to inject it back into an established culture, most of the time, the body rejects the organ. This is the number one reason for corporate innovation failure.
Microsoft is a focus because it has come full circle in its cultural journey. From its emergence as a jean-clad team of motivated comrades, it became bloated by bureaucracy. At the same time, in-fighting caused its innovation and products to fail, and Microsoft ultimately became a laggard experiencing a “lost decade” as far as market superiority is concerned beginning in 2000. 
Although organizational culture is notoriously difficult to change, at the same time, it is in a constant state of change. The matter that makes up the organization is ephemeral. We see form and automatically assume permanence and stability. Even our own human body is in a constant state of change. Here’s a quote from Steve Grand, British computer scientist, roboticist, and author of “Creation: Life and How to Make It.” 
Transitioning from a Traditional Organization to a Learning Organization
“Not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place (your birth). Every bit of you has been replaced many times over (which is why you eat, of course). You are not even the same shape as you were then. The point is that you are like a cloud: something that persists over long periods, while simultaneously being in flux. Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you. Whatever you are, therefore, you are not the stuff of which you are made. If that doesn’t make the hair stand up on the back of your neck, read it again until it does, because it is important.”
— Steve Grand
The same can be said for evolutionary businesses. A constant influx of new processes, technology, and people help these organizations solve the problems of the present and future, not the past. Things that no longer solve the business’ problems are replaced.
To change your company, you have to change your culture in a certain way. To change your culture, you have to change your people. That is expensive. Amazon’s internal capabilities, based on its people, allow it to build things very quickly. Google has the same capabilities, as does Facebook and many other tech companies. But this is because they have the wherewithal: capital.
If you don’t have the capabilities then your time to build a project is going to be longer, particularly if you have a quality product. To build new things, you need to hire people who can test and learn, not maintenance people. You need to hire people who aren’t simply operators but are abstract thinkers and problem solvers. You need to hire people who develop and design in totally new ways for totally new demographics. That is a costly proposition. 
Without that investment, you are not going to be able to produce the same quality of product in the same time, and you will fall further behind. Thus, you have to fix the root problem which is your capabilities, your culture, and your team. Acquisition is a great way to innovate. The biggest and best companies acquire top employees by advertising a dynamic culture. Top performers are attracted to this environment because they want to solve hard problems all the time with like-minded peers. The problem here is that most companies fail to consider diversity and inclusion, and their talent pool becomes homogenized.
Data’s Role in Culture Change
It takes a unique and expensive set of skills to change and evolve every day based on data. Most companies change in a traditional way; they simply press repeat on proven marketing or branding tactics . But the growth button is evolving every day in technology, and it’s hard to get your finger on it. The divergence between growth based on data and growth based on tradition is why the tech companies are outperforming many industries.  
Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft gave his insights on the topic of corporate innovation in an interview with The David Rubenstein Show. 
The interesting thing (that) happens when a company becomes successful is this beautiful virtuous cycle that gets created between your concept or product, your capability and your culture. Right? You really have all these three things fall into gear and they’re working super well. But then what happens is the concept that made you successful runs out of gas. It’s not growing anymore. You now need new capability. And in order to have that new capability you need a culture that allows you to grow that new capability. Right? 
Our server business was growing strong double digits. It was a high margin business. You look around on the other side of the lake, there is a very low margin business called the cloud. People were looking and saying: “Why would we do that when we have such an amazing fast-growing high margin business?” That I think is the challenge. So to be able to see these secular trends long before they become conventional wisdom, change your business model, change your technology, and change the product is the challenge of business. 
You know in tech it’s unforgiving. But quite frankly now that tech is part of every business, I think all of us have to deal with it.
— Satya Nadella
Companies like Amazon use data—customer data—to identify trends. This customer focus, combined with the knowledge that Amazon amasses from its platforms and touchpoints, ensures that Amazon has the greatest opportunity to be right. Evolution becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Which is why Jeff Bezos emphasizes again and again that “it is always Day 1 at Amazon,”— that the company is always learning and changing. Want to find out what happens on Day 2? Check out Bezos’ 2017 letter to shareholders. The letter reads, “Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1.”
So, Amazon’s ethos is to always be seeking change or die a slow and painful death. Amazon shows us why data needs to be at the root of corporate culture.
Inclusive Learning and Data
Inclusive learning means that you have a culture that openly shares data and knowledge. This levels the power playing field. In this environment, the person with the best data informs what decision should be made rather than the person with the most power, clout, or the loudest voice.
Exclusive learning, on the other hand, means that only a select few—perhaps only those on the project team—learn the new information. Even if there is a delay in the release of information so that, over time, the field is level, you are still creating temporary information asymmetry that can create fear or anxiety. 
I’m not advocating that you should share everything all the time—far from it. My point is that information asymmetry creates anxiety. This fear felt by the team is totally normal. Change introduces fear, often inherently, so it is best to address this fear head on with transparency and consistent timelines. Communicate with the team. Yes, things are changing. Here’s the process we’re going through. Here’s, when we’ll know the results. Here’s when you’ll know the results. Here’s why there’s a delay. Explain any need for confidentiality for legal or investor-related concerns.  
Data’s Role in Consensus-building
When changing from a traditional organization to a learning organization, the process is one of change management. First, you need consensus from the people at the top.  
Data is a great way to build consensus. Using data, you can identify and understand your customer, your competition, and your context. With that knowledge, you can tell a story that backs up your strategy and builds consensus. Here is how our competition is solving the customer’s needs, here is how we are solving the customer’s needs, here’s our plan for success.
If getting buy in at the top is a challenge, don’t dismiss the power of the bottom. Most organizations are a pyramid in shape, unfortunately. If you can build a coalition of people along the bottom of the pyramid, and that is not meant in the pejorative sense, you can build a consensus that leadership will find it hard to ignore. 
Here is a process that I followed when seeking support for a venture:
Gather data and share it
Have a vigorous conversation to get alignment
Share that common narrative with the rest of the organization
Use your culture carriers to further your cause and build buy-in
Culture Carriers
What is a culture carrier? Culture carriers should be in almost every change management paradigm. Culture carriers are those people who empathize with your mission and the data that you have to legitimize your cause. These individuals act as messengers for your cause between the silos and groups in an organization. They carry new ideas from one group to another, and then carry feedback from the target group to the originating group. These representatives are trusted by all, and they break down the silos by inviting people in for vigorous debate. 
Culture carriers contribute to the daily workflow by bringing their department’s data to the table. While the connections may at first be tenuous—they will become increasingly clear. For example, culture carriers expose issues with direct insights and knowledge. For example, the cost of janitorial staff and supplies could be excessive and detracting from another part of the business. A culture carrier might bring this and other issues to light.
Culture and the Value Chain
When examining your culture, remember that culture is what drives what employees do when management is not around. I’ve found more often than not that—regardless of what management says—if the right people in the places are aligned with the customer, the company is in a good place. Thus, you need your culture to be aligned with your value chain.
However, as I have suggested, it’s rare that people self-servingly align their personal interests with the long-term interests of the business. Doing so does not make sense for most people, who may not be around in that firm in five years. Culture is the intangible tool that can align these disparate motivations—or create significant friction.  
Consider the politics in your organization? Is there a strict hierarchy? Is there ignorance that is inspiring fear that, in turn, leads to inaction? Or, on the other end of the spectrum, do you have a bunch of people hacking stuff together and running experiments all the time? Both are potentially viable ways of running a company, but one has a measurable pattern that can be scaled and managed to produce more reliable results than people fighting for their own political and personal interests.  
The ultimate goal is to align individual motivation with relevant data and facts that drive improved decision making—lower costs, newer products, different services, new approaches to old problems. If you can get to this stage, you’ve done a great job of creating structural incentives. These incentives will support the behaviors that will advance your strategy, even when management is not around.
For the purposes of your analysis, the culture that is most pervasive in your organization should be the focus. The executive culture is probably different from the managerial culture, which is probably different from the operational culture. Teams in the same discipline in the same office even have their own culture. 
Look at the culture that is a result of the legacy business that is driving decisions—not your company’s mission statement. I’ve found that mission statements make great wall art, but don’t do much for strategy. 
Enron, for example, had a wonderful list of corporate values: Respect, Integrity, Communication, and Excellence. Each had their own detailed description. For example, respect was defined as the following: “We treat others as we would like to be treated ourselves … We do not tolerate abusive or disrespectful treatment. Ruthlessness, callousness, and arrogance don’t belong here.”  
Enron is a glaring example that written values and mission statements, while an important part of creating a corporate identity, are meaningless without culture creation and management. Enron’s culture was well known for its lavish excesses that persisted right up until the firm’s bankruptcy. Neela Banerjee, David Barboza, and Audrey Warren reported in-depth on Enron’s unchecked lavish spending—a $1.5 million-dollar Christmas party at Enron Field and Waterford crystal gifts for Secretaries day, for example —which created a culture that ultimately led to the company’s downfall.
A true culture can be explored by understanding the value chain. Enron’s value chain included fraud, and the fraud was dependent on public displays of extravagance and success. While hidden from the outside, the relationship from the inside was obvious.
Amazon’s value chain is reflected in its leadership principles, and these are clearly laid out on its recruitment webpageso that job-seekers understand the culture from the get-go.
Ben Thompson explains the relationship between the value chain and culture on his Exponent Podcast:
“Culture is an outgrowth of the value chain. What is culture? Culture is the accumulation of decisions that worked out and it becomes subconscious.. this is how we do things.. this is how things work.
Well, by definition, if you have a value chain that is working tremendously well and throwing off huge amounts of cash, the way that value chain works and the way things have to work are going to go hand in hand. The culture is going to have the same structure, the same shape, as the value chain. The culture is the floating-in-the-air version of the value chain, but they have the exact same shape. They’re basically twins… That’s absolutely a reason why this type of analysis matters.
But the question is: how do you determine a company’s culture? If you don’t work at a company, how can you understand what that culture is and know if that’s the determining factor. And if what we’re saying is correct, you can actually start to predict a company’s culture from the outside by looking at their value chain. By understanding how they make money, how they go to market, how they acquire customers, how they acquire suppliers, all these sort of pieces and you can jump from that to say, well, this has worked so well for them, they going forward are going to be anchored in this mindset and they’re going to make assumptions. 
What’s so challenging about culture issues is that you make assumptions and decisions subconsciously — you’re not even aware that you’re making them. You have Walmart, advertising a fast, faster, fastest model of ecommerce that is transparently ridiculous, but why? Because they were so locked into this killer model … when the reality is it took them years to realize that was totally wrong. Why did it take them years? Because of culture. Culture blinds them. Where did that culture come from? It came from them having a value chain that worked fabulously for decades. All of this stuff is tied together.”
— Ben Thompson
But what if you can’t determine a clear path to the market? Having multiple teams compete against one another is a great way to find your way to the future. If you have a couple of hypotheses, and you’re not really sure how to bring them to life, competing teams have natural incentives to find working solutions at scale. However, if competition is implemented poorly— which it often is—you risk hurting company culture. Also, most businesses don’t have the resources to have multiple teams solving the same problem. Most businesses have to pick a direction and then make that direction the right one.
To make a single direction work, strategy and priorities will constantly be in flux. Culture is critical in these situations. It has a significant influence on the direction that’s chosen, think of the power dynamics and native incentives for employees and teams.  
It’s difficult to manage a change in direction without creating fear. People may lose the understanding of their own job function. All of a sudden, the incentives may be totally different. The company may want five KPIs instead of one. The company could drop brand marketing for search advertising, or the company could transition from managing products to building products. These are radical changes. If you have a culture of permission and give people the time to learn, experiment, and fail into this, then you have a lot of money and time, like Facebook. Most companies aren’t Facebook.
Traditional companies tend to mix test and learn with a significant amount of operational efficiency. Testing and learning is great, and necessary to find massive, step-wise discoveries. But sometimes testing and learning is a luxury. Thus, it helps to ensure that a hypothesis can be valuable even in failure. As Amazon knows, basing decisions on data will give you the greatest opportunity to be right.
The following are examples of notable corporate cultures— Netflix, Facebook, Microsoft, and Enron and the results of their culture efforts. Because every company is different, there is no single approach, and every company must conduct its own analyses and make its own path forward.
Case Studies: Netflix, Facebook, Microsoft, and Enron
“Anything is possible for a company when its culture is about listening, learning, and harnessing individual passions and talents to the company’s mission.” 
—Satya Natella, Hit Refresh via Fast Company, 2017
The following case studies illustrate the fleeting and ephemeral nature of culture. Some firms have succeeded in dominating markets using diverse techniques to drive value creation through corporate culture. Others have found themselves burdened with lawsuits or annihilated.
Moreover, causal relationships between culture and corporate performance are difficult to prove. Some of these case studies provide models that have worked in the past, but they should be taken with a grain of salt; it could be one or many variables that are the reason for a firm’s success.
For example, many of these teams can attract top-tier talent from day one, which is an advantage that many other firms may lack. Therefore, employing the strategies or abandoning any of the strategies exhibited by one firm is not likely to have the same effect on another firm.
Netflix’s Dream Team
Back In 2009, Netflix published its groundbreaking Netflix “Freedom & Responsibility” culture deck, and while it was not the first company to implement such standards, it was one of the first to communicate them so transparently.
Netflix now has a whole section of its website devoted to its culture, which provides transparency and sets the tone for potential employees. Here is an excerpt from the site.
“Like all great companies, we strive to hire the best, and we value integrity, excellence, respect, and collaboration. What is special about Netflix, though, is how much we:
1. Encourage independent decision-making by employees
2. Share information openly, broadly, and deliberately
3. Are extraordinarily candid with each other
4. Keep only our highly effective people
5. Avoid rules
Our core philosophy is people over process. More specifically, we have great people working together as a dream team.”
— Netflix, 2017
Netflix’s approach to building a culture, from its recruitment strategy to its R&D, helped it transition from DVDs to a video streaming service with nearly 118 million subscribers, globally.
Kevin Kruse, founder of leadership training company LEADx.org, interviewed Patty McCord, ex-chief talent officer for Netflix and author of Powerful: Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility. Kruse asked McCord to explain the Netflix culture model.
According to McCord, Netflix gives employees more freedom but with responsibility. The company also communicates a clear context in which to work, “The idea of context is really, really important. Who are our competitors? Where are we at? Let me go through the P&L with you and let you understand how the financials work before we talk about the budget for your department” stated McCord.
McCord also emphasized a unique hiring approach. The hiring process is initiated by a problem that the company recognizes needs to be solved. If there are no in-house resources that can solve the problem—junior staff, for example—external candidates are selected based on their ability to solve that problem.
While Netflix has its hiring sorted out. It seems that its employees are not as impressed with its corporate culture. A study by Blind, a networking app, surveyed over 11,000 of its users in early 2020. According to Ashley Rodriguez, senior reporter for Business Insider, while just over 70% of the Netflix respondents said that Netflix “did a good job facilitating the hiring process” only 44% of Netflix respondents said the company cared about the well-being of Netflix employees, and only 32% said the company cared about employee’s professional development.
Facebook: Lessons in Scaling Culture
Facebook attracts plenty of attention from culture enthusiasts mainly because it has created a unique culture among its engineers, its most prized asset. Facebook’s engineers are given great latitude in decision making. According to Matt Rosoff, reporter for Business Insider, “Facebook is driven by engineers, not marketers or managers, and they trust each other to do the right thing.”
The following is an excerpt from Yee Lee, a four-time founder and product manager, which describes how Facebook ships code and illustrates the autonomy given to the company’s software engineers.
Development servers. Each engineer has their own copy of the entire site. Engineers can make a change, see the consequences, and reverse the change in seconds without affecting anyone else.
Code review. Engineers can propose a change, get feedback, and improve or abandon it in minutes or hours, all before affecting any people using Facebook.
Internal usage. Engineers can make a change, get feedback from thousands of employees using the change, and roll it back in an hour.
Staged rollout. We can begin deploying a change to a billion people and, if the metrics tank, take it back before problems affect most people using Facebook.
Dynamic configuration. If an engineer has planned for it in the code, we can turn off an offending feature in production in seconds. Alternatively, we can dial features up and down in tiny increments (i.e., only 0.1% percent of people see the feature) to discover and avoid non-linear effects.
Soft launches. When we roll out a feature or application with a minimum of fanfare it can be pulled back with a minimum of public attention.
Engineers are responsible for their own quality assurance testing — there’s no dedicated QA team, although a Test Engineering team does create QA tools for engineers to use.
Any engineer can check in code to any part of Facebook’s code base. Code is reviewed and can be blocked before it’s pushed live, however.
— Lee, 2011
According to Rosoff, “Facebook’s culture permits a ratio of engineers to product managers of between seven and 10 to one.” Facebook’s momentum in scaling is second to none. “This, combined with the prospect of becoming rich when Facebook goes public of course, is why so many bright people want to work at Facebook,” states Rosoff, “and that’s why older and larger companies like Google are having to pay huge bonuses to keep their staff from bolting.”
While Facebook’s culture allowed them to quickly scale to become one of the most valuable companies in the world, it isn’t without its problems. The engineer-centric “ship early and ship often” mindset that pushes out code ASAP is a major contributing factor into why Facebook struggles with consumer trust and regulation.
Since the creation of Facebook, choices were made to benefit developers both within and outside Facebook. Take this quote from Mark Zuckerberg’s 2010 F8 address when talking about the Open Graph API: “We’ve had this policy where you can’t store and cache any data for more than 24 hours, and we’re going to go ahead and we’re going to get rid of that policy,” Zuckerberg said. The audience cheered. “We think that this step is going to make building with Facebook Platform a lot simpler.”
This permanence, combined with the Open Graph API’s long list of available data from both personal and friends’ accounts, built the environment that allowed the Cambridge Analytica scandal to happen. While this issue may have been viewed with leniency for a smaller startup, Facebook had nearly 1.4 billion users and a market cap of around $200 billion when that data was available. The culture that had helped make Facebook into a giant didn’t evolve to meet the needs of a giant company.
Despite Facebook’s alleged autonomy where its engineers are concerned, the company has its mechanisms to control employees and turn them into automatons to head off incoming attacks. Facebook has “Lockdown”, Alibaba has “996, and Amazon has its already discussed rigorous culture. 
The following appeared in Vanity Fair and is an excerpt from a book by a former Facebook employee Antonio García Martínez. It describes Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook’s militaristic and autocratic response to the threat posed by the launch of Google Plus in 2011. 
It hit Facebook like a bomb. Zuck took it as an existential threat comparable to the Soviets’ placing nukes in Cuba in 1962. Google Plus was the great enemy’s sally into our own hemisphere, and it gripped Zuck like nothing else. He declared “Lockdown,” the first and only one during my time there. As was duly explained to the more recent employees, Lockdown was a state of war that dated to Facebook’s earliest days, when no one could leave the building while the company confronted some threat, either competitive or technical.
How, might you ask, was Lockdown officially announced? We received an email at 1:45 pm the day Google Plus launched, instructing us to gather around the Aquarium, the glass-walled cube that was Zuck’s throne room. Actually, it technically instructed us to gather around the Lockdown sign. This was a neon sign bolted to the upper reaches of the Aquarium, above the cube of glass, almost like the NO VACANCY sign on a highway motel. By the time the company had gathered itself around, that sign was illuminated, tipping us off to what was coming.
It was delivered completely impromptu from the open space next to the stretch of desks where the executive staff sat. All of Facebook’s engineers, designers, and product managers gathered around him in a rapt throng; the scene brought to mind a general addressing his troops in the field.
The contest for users, he told us, would now be direct and zero-sum. Google had launched a competing product; whatever was gained by one side would be lost by the other. It was up to all of us to up our game while the world conducted live tests of Facebook versus Google’s version of Facebook and decided which it liked more. He hinted vaguely at product changes we would consider in light of this new competitor. The real point, however, was to have everyone aspire to a higher bar of reliability, user experience, and site performance.
In a company whose overarching mantras were DONE IS BETTER THAN PERFECT and PERFECT IS THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD, this represented a course correction, a shift to the concern for quality that typically lost out to the drive to ship. It was the sort of nagging paternal reminder to keep your room clean that Zuck occasionally dished out after Facebook had suffered some embarrassing bug or outage.
Rounding off another beaded string of platitudes, he changed gears and erupted with a burst of rhetoric referencing one of the ancient classics he had studied at Harvard and before. “You know, one of my favorite Roman orators ended every speech with the phrase Carthago delenda est. ‘Carthage must be destroyed.’ For some reason I think of that now.” He paused as a wave of laughter tore through the crowd.
The aforementioned orator was Cato the Elder, a noted Roman senator and inveigher against the Carthaginians, who clamored for the destruction of Rome’s great challenger in what became the Third Punic War. Reputedly, he ended every speech with that phrase, no matter the topic.
Carthago delenda est. Carthage must be destroyed!
Zuckerberg’s tone went from paternal lecture to martial exhortation, the drama mounting with every mention of the threat Google represented. The speech ended to a roar of cheering and applause. Everyone walked out of there ready to invade Poland if need be. It was a rousing performance. Carthage must be destroyed!
In the Trenches
The Facebook Analog Research Laboratory jumped into action and produced a poster with CARTHAGO DELENDA EST splashed in imperative bold type beneath a stylized Roman centurion’s helmet. This improvised printshop made all manner of posters and ephemera, often distributed semi-furtively at nights and on weekends, in a fashion reminiscent of Soviet samizdat. The art itself was always exceptional, evoking both the mechanical typography of World War II-era propaganda posters and contemporary Internet design, complete with faux vintage logos. This was Facebook’s ministry of propaganda, and it was originally started with no official permission or budget, in an unused warehouse space. In many ways, it was the finest exemplar of Facebook values: irreverent yet bracing in its martial qualities.
The Carthago posters went up immediately all over the campus and were stolen almost as fast. It was announced that the cafés would be open over the weekends, and a proposal was seriously floated to have the shuttles from Palo Alto and San Francisco run on the weekends, too. This would make Facebook a fully seven-days-a-week company; by whatever means, employees were expected to be in and on duty. In what was perceived as a kindly concession to the few employees with families, it was also announced that families were welcome to visit on weekends and eat in the cafés, allowing the children to at least see Daddy (and, yes, it was mostly Daddy) on weekend afternoons. My girlfriend and our one-year-old daughter, Zoë, came by, and we weren’t the only family there, by any stretch. Common was the scene of the swamped Facebook employee with logo’d hoodie spending an hour of quality time with his wife and two kids before going back to his desk.
And what was everyone working on?
For those in the user-facing side of Facebook, it meant thinking twice on a code change amid the constant, hell-for-leather dash to ship some new product bell or whistle, so we wouldn’t look like the half-assed, thrown-together, social-media Frankenstein we occasionally were.
For us in the Ads team, it was mostly corporate solidarity that made us join the weekend-working mob. At Facebook, even then and certainly later, you got along by going along, and everyone sacrificing his or her entire life for the cause was as much about self-sacrifice and team building as it was an actual measure of your productivity. This was a user battle, not a revenue one, and there was little we could do to help wage the Google Plus Punic War, other than not totally horrifying users with some aggressive new Ads product—something nobody had the nerve to do in those pre-IPO days.

Enron: Values vs. Culture
“Units were sometimes reorganized three or four times a year, which always meant moving people around, at a cost of roughly $500 a person just to set up a new desk…On any given weekend, several hundred people would be moved from one floor to another at Enron.”
— Cheryl Brashier, administrative assistant, Enron
Enron is infamous for a culture that resulted in explosive public demise. While the inside of the company was shrouded in darkness and turmoil, Enron was pushing value statements that made it seem like a responsible and positive corporate citizen. This mismatch is covered in-depth in Patrick M. Lencioni’s Harvard Business Review article, “Make Your Values Mean Something.” An excerpt from the article:
“Take a look at this list of corporate values: Communication. Respect. Integrity. Excellence. They sound pretty good, don’t they? Strong, concise, meaningful. Maybe they even resemble your own company’s values, the ones you spent so much time writing, debating, and revising. If so, you should be nervous. These are the corporate values of Enron, as stated in the company’s 2000 annual report. And as events have shown, they’re not meaningful; they’re meaningless.”
— Patrick M. Lencioni, Harvard Business Review
Enron is a shining example that written values and mission statements, while an important part of creating a corporate identity, are meaningless without culture creation and management.
Enron’s culture was well known for its lavish excesses that persisted right up until the firm’s bankruptcy. Neela Banerjee, David Barboza, and Audrey Warren reported in-depth on Enron’s unchecked lavish spending—a $1.5 million-dollar Christmas party at Enron Field and Waterford crystal gifts for secretaries day, for example—which created a culture that ultimately led to the company’s downfall.
The internal “go-go” culture, according to Banerjee, Barboza, and Warren, was buttressed by lax or nonexistent risk controls that had once been state of the art. Enron staff were rewarded with inflated salaries, which they justified by 12-hour work days and extended travel schedules. Enron employees flew first or business class and stayed at luxury hotels. According to Banerjee et al., “The company’s parking garage was filled with Porsches, Ferraris, and BMW’s, emblems of the sizable bonuses many employees earned.”
”Appearances were very important,” said Jeff Gray, a former economist at Enron Energy Services.” It was important for employees to believe the hype just as it was important for analysts and investors to believe it.”
Enron is an example of an unsustainable culture, albeit one that employees initially fell in love with. It was dizzyingly intoxicating in the short term, but there was no solid foundation on which it could survive—it was all a ruse.
According to one employee, ”We knew we weren’t making money, but the extravagance was what made it great to work there.”
Microsoft: A Culture Turned Full Circle
Microsoft has come full circle where its culture is concerned. While it was once the most powerful company in the world, its antitrust case and its debacle with stack ranking hobbled the company and created a culture of surveillance and fear. 
In the early 2000s, Microsoft’s journey passed through what Kurt Eichenwald, writer for Vanity Fair, called, “The Lost Decade.” During this period, Microsoft struggled with bleak sales from Windows Phone 7 and glitches with various technologies while Google, Facebook, and Apple came to the fore with a mix of social media platform and tech products. Microsoft relied on Windows, Office, and servers to prop up its financial performance.
According to Eichenwald, in the 2000s, Microsoft’s stock barely budged from around $30, while Apple’s stock grew more than 20 times over the same period.
“In December 2000, Microsoft had a market capitalization of $510 billion, making it the world’s most valuable company. As of June [2012] it is No. 3, with a market cap of $249 billion. In December 2000, Apple had a market cap of $4.8 billion and didn’t even make the list. As of this June, it [Apple] is No. 1 in the world, with a market cap of $541 billion,” wrote Eichenwald in 2012.
What caused Microsoft’s role reversal during its lost decade? Eichenwald describes Microsoft’s change as one that went from a lean machine led by young, talented visionaries to a bloated bureaucracy that stifled creative ideas, if any even emerged.
“Where Microsoft programmers were once barefoot programmers in Hawaiian shirts working through nights and weekends toward a common goal of excellence; instead, life behind the thick corporate walls had become staid and brutish. Fiefdoms had taken root, and a mastery of internal politics emerged as key to career success,”
— Kurt Eichenwald, Vanity Fair
Rather than crippling competitors, co-workers were experiencing internal conflict. Policies like stack ranking meant that employees were rewarded for sabotaging their teammates. When the antitrust case occurred, Microsoft executives buckled under the pressure of constant scrutiny.
Even Bill Gates, when he signed a consent decree to resolve one of its monopoly investigations in 1994, was aware of how entrenched the culture was at Microsoft. He told a reporter that the decree was essentially pointless for the company’s various divisions: “None of the people who run those divisions are going to change what they do or think,” Gates said.
In 2014, Satya Nadella took over as CEO from Steve Ballmer. Lo and behold, Nadella changed the culture at Microsoft to one that is customer focused. According to Peter Cohen, contributor to Forbes, “Nadella created a culture that focused Microsoft on supplying customers what they wanted rather than forcing Windows products down their gullets.” As a result, Microsoft stock soared from $90 to around $180 in mid-2020. Fast Company ranked Microsoft as the second most innovative company in 2020 beating out Tesla and with Snap as number one. Nadella’s approach changed the culture and the bottom line.
According to Cohen, Nadella coalesced its global subsidiaries around the customer’s wants and needs. Improved attention to customers garnered consumer trust and a willingness to buy Microsoft’s products once again.
Additionally, Microsoft had the resources that allowed it to scale new products. The company changed its development processes, and its people. In the words of Nadella, 
“We had to introduce and to promote new products and business models ([software as a service] vs. perpetual [licenses]). We had to drive our employees to interact with new corporate decision-makers—business vs. the original technical ones. We had to scale our employees to master new advanced products. In order to be successful, new skills were needed. We had to promote and to support learning.”
— Satya Nadella
This was what Nadella called the “growth mindset.”
Nadella encouraged his teams by allowing them to learn, try, and fail, and relied heavily on data at all times. However, he also loaded the pressure onto the shoulders of his 150 top executives, 
“Once you become a vice president, a partner in this endeavor, the whining is over. You can’t say the coffee around here is bad, or there aren’t enough good people, or I didn’t get the bonus. To be a leader in this company, your job is to find the rose petals in a pile of shit. You are the champions of overcoming constraints.”
— Satya Nadella
The Downsides of Performance-Based Culture: How Stack Ranking Backfired for Amazon, Microsoft, and Yahoo
While the performance-based cultures built by companies like Amazon have been lauded, they don’t exist without their downsides. Measuring and incentivizing employee performance can be a great way to achieve results. However, go too far and the culture can quickly become one of fear.
From the Harvard Business Review article, “Making Business Personal” by Robert Kegan,  Lisa Lahey, Andy Fleming, and Matthew Miller,  fear is an inhibitor to evolution, “To an extent that we ourselves are only beginning to appreciate, most people at work, even in high-performing organizations, divert considerable energy every day to a second job that no one has hired them to do: preserving their reputations, putting their best selves forward, and hiding their inadequacies from others and themselves. We believe this is the single biggest cause of wasted resources in nearly every company today.”
We find an example of policies that can create cultures of fear with the once-trendy practice of stack ranking.
Stack ranking is an employee rating system that some have described as a Darwinian practice that amounts to survival of the fittest. It is a process that has been implemented (and subsequently dismantled) at tech giants including Amazon, Microsoft, and Yahoo. Jack Welch, CEO of GE, first implemented the process that was designed to eliminate less productive staff and constantly build up a team of the most productive workers. Basically, employees rated their peers.
A former software developer at Microsoft described the stack ranking experience to Eichenwald, writer for Vanity Fair, “Every unit was forced to declare a certain percentage of employees as top performers, then good performers, then average, then below average, then poor,” said the software developer, “If you were on a team of 10 people, you walked in the first day knowing that, no matter how good everyone was, two people were going to get a great review, seven were going to get mediocre reviews, and one was going to get a terrible review.”
According to Julie Bort, chief tech correspondent for Business Insider, “the problem is that it’s really only valuable for a short time, such as when a company is reorganizing, stack ranking experts say. Using it long-term tends to create a dog-eat-dog kind of culture.”
Amazon used stack ranking, or “rank and yank” as it was coined by those in the know, to rate employees against each other as opposed to how well they met their job requirements. Amazon was not the only tech giant to try stack ranking. According to Bort, Microsoft tried it but ditched it in 2015, and Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer attempted to use it when attempting to fix the company’s woes in 2012.
Eichenwald provides an in-depth account of Microsoft’s rise and fall including its dabbling in the stack ranking process. According to some that Eichenwald talked to, it was considered “the most destructive process inside of Microsoft, something that drove out untold numbers of employees.”
The result for Microsoft was a culture where the pressure employees felt to be strong competitors internally overshadowed the focus on team dynamics and contributed to the company’s prolonged lackluster performance.
Changing Existing Culture
“A recent Deloitte survey showed that 94% of executives believed that a strong culture was important to business success. But if you asked them who was responsible for managing culture or how they would manage it, most wouldn’t have a clue.”
— Charles O’Reilly via Lisa Holton, Stanford, 2014
Changing culture is a long and difficult journey. O’Reilly notes that most mature companies don’t take risks. They are focused on incremental short-term improvements, and employees are rewarded for behaviors that are not conducive to long-term success. They follow proven methods rather than experimenting with new ones.
O’Reilly goes on to state that part of the difficulty in changing a culture is making people understand and elucidate what it is so that they can then envision how to change it. Leadership faces the challenge of seeing the data that makes up their reality and helping their organization understand. As Ben Thompson of Stratechery explains:
“This is the power CEOs have. They cannot do all the work, and they cannot impact industry trends beyond their control. But they can choose whether or not to accept reality, and in so doing, impact the worldview of all those they lead.”
But to drive change is more than understanding the need to change. Culture change must go far beyond inviting thought leaders to speak at annual events. That helps to educate managers and employers of the need for a positive environment, but it won’t lead to concrete change.
For that, you need metrics. Efforts and results need to be quantified so that change is transparent and there are actual results. Through measurements and rewards, there is accountability. Another point to remember is that a culture assessment might reveal that not all areas of an organization might require change—there may be pockets of an organization that require change while other core cultural components may be strong.
Identifying Necessary Cultural Change
“Any organization focused on transformational change must commit to a focused initiative designed to help turn the survey analysis into action. The most basic part of this effort is a feedback and action planning process to take place throughout the company” 
— Daniel R. Denison, founding partner, Denison
Sometimes, the effects of a misaligned culture can be felt and observed throughout a workplace. People talk behind other people’s backs, desks are devoid of personal belongings, or passive-aggressive emotions are felt throughout the building. While these signals are all important, they won’t convince leadership that a problem exists. Data is required.
Because change requires funding, and funding requires metrics, the root cause of cultural issues need to be quantified to secure buy-in from leaders. Before beginning to think about culture change, the existing culture needs to be assessed to extract meaningful metrics.
Consider the following questions that reflect an organization’s culture:
Who makes decisions?
How are decisions made?
Who has direct communication with who?
How are departments structured?
How are employees incentivized?
How are internal conflicts resolved?
How is recruitment and retention managed?
In the best-case scenario, there is supporting data that answers these questions. For example, determining how much revenue comes from one area can indicate the cultural health of separate business functions. Areas with strong revenue might offer ideas for best practices that other parts of the organization can emulate. Similarly, determining how long revenues have been generated in one area may signal that decisions are too focused and there is a risk of disruption from lack of diversity.
With data and metrics, culture becomes more tangible, and there is a basis for a plan to rebuild or improve any frailties.
But transition is hard. If you put someone into an unfamiliar environment, there will be a learning curve. Some within the company will have trouble during a transition. People must go from being “pioneers” to “settlers,” and pioneers often have a hard time settling down. It helps to create temporary roles in the organization to shepherd the company across the chasm. While the target market segment manager works to break onto the beachhead, the whole product manager handles product debugging.
Culture Assessment Tools
There are increasing tools available for cultural assessments. For examples of software for culture surveys, see Denison’s organizational culture surveys, Creative Difference, and Know Your Company. Gary Swart, general partner at Polaris Partners gives examples of questions that can be asked in a survey to gauge the state of culture.
Typical data that reveal cultural factors are worker to manager ratios and retention rates. However, some companies experience high turnover but still manage to excel. PayScale lists the companies with the most and least “loyal” employees according to average employee tenure. High on the list of companies with the least loyal employees are Amazon, Google, Mass Mutual Financial Group, and Aflac.
What Does a Growth-oriented Culture Look Like?
Charles A. O’Reilly is the Frank E. Buck Professor of Management at Stanford Graduate School of Business. In research conducted with Jennifer A. Chatman and Bernadette Doerr at the University of California–Berkeley and David F. Caldwell at Santa Clara University, he pointed to grit, adaptability, and resilience in employees as cultural factors that drive growth in tech firms specifically.
The team used the adaptive nature of Silicon Valley firms as illustrative examples of adaptable cultures and contrasts these firms with Ford’s rigidity before CEO Alan Mulally took the helm.
To define adaptability, the researchers cite cultures that nurture the following behaviors:
risk-taking
a willingness to experiment
innovation
personal initiative
fast decision-making and execution
the ability to spot unique opportunities
O’Reilly and colleagues also noted that adaptive cultures put less emphasis on “being careful, predictable, avoiding conflict, and making your numbers.” According to O’Reilly, “Ford attempted three turnaround efforts over the last 15 years. Two of them failed abysmally. This last one, under Mulally, succeeded but only because Mulally succeeded in turning around a dysfunctional culture.”
The researchers conclude that “corporate cultures that emphasize adaptability generally produce “revenue growth, market and book value, ‘most admired’ ratings, employee satisfaction, and stock analysts’ recommendations.” The essential mechanism, O’Reilly says, “is the alignment of culture with strategy.”
Building Culture:
Case Studies on CSAA Insurance Group and Thompson Reuters
CSAA Insurance Group (CSAA IG)
CSAA Insurance Group (CSAA IG) has almost 4,000 employees and is an interesting model and study on culture change. Soren Kaplan, author of The Invisible Advantage and founder of InnovationPoint describes CSAA’s approach in the Harvard Business Review.
The company first addressed its capabilities in terms of skills, and “innovation” was added to the company’s values statement and included as a core competency for employees. However, if employees were to be evaluated based on innovation, the term would have to be clearly defined.
The executive team chose to specify three types of innovation that employees should strive to embody—incremental, evolutionary, and disruptive. Clearly, evolutionary and disruptive innovation are tall orders, so most innovation was “small tweaks that advanced the core business,” for example, improvements to existing processes, customer experience, and insurance products.
Not surprisingly, the company allocates fewer resources to evolutionary and disruptive innovation and invests more in employee training, innovation tools, and design-thinking based initiatives. According to Kaplan, “Employees participate in a half-day program that tackles real business problems facing their workgroups and results in a prioritized list of ideas.”
The efforts have paid off in terms of tangible and measurable results. For example, “a team of insurance underwriters analyzed call data and led improvements to voice prompts that reduced misrouted phone interactions to their department by 40%. Other teams have helped streamline the process for issuing proof of insurance cards and are contributing to prototyping efforts for ‘smart claims’ systems, allowing customers to submit images of damaged property for online assessment.”
To make sure that action is taken on ideas solicited by employees, managers, whose act similarly to culture carriers, discuss the various ideas with teams and select specific ideas to be cleared by upper management. “Employees also have access to CSAA IG’s “Innovation Hub,” an online portal with a design-thinking toolkit, a calendar of innovation-related events, self-paced training materials, and articles from innovation experts. The company has also set up an idea management platform, where various departments can post their innovation challenges, and where the crowd can contribute, evaluate, and develop solutions.
To help generate excitement for the idea management platform, during the first online innovation challenge event, anyone who submitted an idea was surprised with a physical paper light bulb posted in their cubicle workspace. With light bulbs popping up all around the office, employees’ motivation to participate skyrocketed—and the company’s first online challenge received an 80% participation rate.”
Thomson Reuters
Ron Ashkenas, Partner Emeritus at Schaffer Consulting and author of The Boundaryless Organization, The GE Work-Out, and Simply Effective, and Cary Burch, SVP of Innovation for Thomson Reuters, comment the innovation efforts of Thomson Reuters in the Harvard Business Review.
Thomson Reuters is a $12.5 billion global information solutions company facing all the challenges of a scaled company struggling to maintain an evolutionary culture. 
Acquisition was the main mode for growth until the senior leadership established a “catalyst fund” in 2014. The fund supported internal innovation teams conducting rapid proof of concept on new ideas. 
“The fund was announced on the company’s internal website, and teams from anywhere in the businesses were invited to submit their suggestions. To access the fund, teams had to complete a simple two-page application about their idea, the potential market, and the value to the customer (what problem was being solved). The teams with the most compelling ideas were given an opportunity to present and defend their idea to the innovation investment committee, which included the CEO, CFO, and a few other senior executives. In the first month, five ‘winners’ were announced and then immediately publicized on the Thomson Reuters internal web site. This triggered a great deal of interest, and a steady flow of applications.”
— Ron Ashkenas & Cary Burch, Harvard Business Review, 2014
The company also hired a full-time innovation leader and developed innovation metrics (such as number of ideas being considered and the amount of revenue from new products/services). These data allowed the innovation leader to report the timelines of initiatives and their potential value, information necessary to obtain the buy-in of the executives.
In the same vein as culture carriers, the company appointed “innovation champions” in every business, who “created a common terminology for innovation across the company so that everyone referred to the same types of innovation (e.g., product vs. operational) and referenced the same stages (e.g., “ideation” and “rapid prototyping”). The company built an online Thomson Reuters innovation “toolkit” for employees, and an innovation network intranet where entrepreneurs could share concepts and connect with others to solve customer problems in new ways. The company initiated a communications campaign with blogs, articles, and video interviews with internal innovators and organized an “enterprise innovation workshop,” to identify 10 innovations that would leverage existing company assets and implement them in 100 days or less.
The innovation metrics were constantly revisited and sharpened as evolution occurred, and all steps were transparent so that employees were aware of any changes and encouraged to participate.
According to the article, “innovation is now one of the hottest topics in the company. The innovation ‘network’ is the most visited site on the company’s intranet, and more than 250 ideas were submitted by employees for consideration at the enterprise innovation workshop, some of which are already being implemented. Several Catalyst Fund projects, which span multiple business units, are now being prototyped and piloted with customers and most of the businesses have a robust portfolio of innovative ideas 
What these two case studies emphasize is the value of data, the need for culture carriers to implement change, and how a customer focus can shape behaviors.",15906

Building Culture From the Start
“If you’re comfortable with the amount of freedom you’ve given your employees, you haven’t gone far enough.”
— Laszlo Bock, Ceo of HUMU, Work Rules!
Culture is the determining factor of whether a work environment is conducive to innovation and success, and leadership dictates the tone. Whether employees are on board with new concepts and projects, and willing to adapt to changing times, is largely a reflection of the approach and strategy of human resources management.
An undesirable work culture is often characterized by an “us against them” mindset between employees and management, which is a common but toxic environment that is guaranteed to asphyxiate any creativity. Leadership should strive for a culture of collaboration, where employees are encouraged to push their boundaries and even make mistakes without fear of recrimination.
Leaders and professionals are wising up, changing their strategy, and focusing on creating a more palatable and sustainable employee experience.
The Employee Experience Matters
Times have changed. Loyalty is no longer guaranteed because workers are transient and quick to move on to the next opportunity. A survey of Gen Yers by The Guardian found that over 90 percent of millennials don’t expect to remain with an employer for more than five years. But a revolving door is expensive.
Today, employers must entice new talent and retain talent to be competitive. To attract new talent, recruiting must include outreach, branding, and a smooth onboarding experience. To retain talent, leadership strategies must provide development programs that bring quick results, lateral movement for maximum skills acquisition, create continuous cycles of promotion, and give employees the tools they need to manage their own careers.
According to Jim Guszcza, Deloitte data scientist, Josh Bersin, entrepreneur and influencer, and Jeff Schwartz, Deloitte HR strategist, employees want more flexibility, autonomy, and feelings of engagement. Here’s what the ideal employee experience looks like.

Fundamentally, the employee experience should be based on an emotional bond of trust between the employee and the manager. While levels of trust are difficult to quantify, the good news is that once you accept the idea that culture and leadership are interconnected, the steps to transformation are logical and straightforward – with the right approach.
Design Thinking for Employee Experience
Jon Kolko, VP of design at Blackboard, an education software company  described design thinking for HRM as a strategy that “empowers employees to observe behavior and draw conclusions about what people want and need.” Design thinking places focus on the employee and, in this context, systems and strategies strive to create an employee-centric framework. Cisco changed its HR in 24 hours using this concept, and it can be applied to all HR groups.
17 % | The proportion of executives in a recent survey by management consultants Korn Ferry who considered their current leadership capable of accelerating innovation and improving profitability.
The following pillars of leadership explain in more detail the concept of design thinking for employee experience:
1. The Never-ending Feedback Loop
Leaders must listen incessantly. They must understand what employees need to be productive, creative, and meet the organization’s mission. The process can be as archaic as walking the floor and asking questions or as technologically advanced as an open forum on Fuze.
Employees should have the opportunity to make suggestions, share accomplishments, or be informed of leadership decisions. But the crucial point is that the conversation must always be on, and concrete change must occur as a result of the feedback. Otherwise, any contributions are pointless, and morale will nosedive.
2. Ongoing Growth Opportunities
A significant component of the employee experience is career growth. The ideal employee experience is one that includes an upward career trajectory, but it must be aligned with the needs and constraints of the organization.
In some cases, an employee will max out development potential within an organization, in which case the natural progression is moving to another role with another employer. In other cases, investment in employee development pays off during an employee’s tenure with a company, and the relationship can continue throughout the employee’s career through networks and relationships. This could even lead to strategic partnerships down the road.
In-house mentorships are a development strategy that provide learning opportunities without hefty cost implications. They improve communications and boost a culture of collaboration.
As time and resources allow, companies can get creative when it comes to growth opportunities. Google’s Gmail and AdSense initiated a “20 percent time” program, in which employees were given one day each week to work on a work-related side project of their choosing,”
Companies have many options for employee growth. We’ve outlined some promising tools, such as MOOCs, in our article, “Becoming a Learning Organization.”
3. A Safe Work Environment
For employees to feel free to flex their creative muscles, they need a work environment in which they feel safe – one that is non-threatening and tolerant of diversity. Diversity is key because the intermingling of different perspectives drawn from different minds is the catalyst for breakthroughs.
Jeanne C Meister and Karie Willyerd, cofounders of Future Workplace, explain in the Harvard Business Review that today’s workplace often has five generations from many cultures working together – Traditionalists, Baby Boomers, Gen Xers, Millennials, and Gen 2020 – and each individual should be equally valued for their contribution.
Real-time communication platforms – Cisco Spark, Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Facebook’s Workplace –  social media, and cross-functional teams encourage greater collaboration, inclusion, and team-centric culture. It’s important to realize, however, that diverse backgrounds and increased age ranges in the workforce will mean that not everyone will be able to adjust at the same rate to new processes and technologies.

4. Employee Motivation Based on Recognition and Rewards
The extent of employee buy-in, in other words commitment to a company’s goals, is a measure of employee motivation. If employees sense that their efforts are not valued, they are unlikely to be enthusiastic about future projects. Recognizing and acknowledging contributions can go a long way to fostering a mutually supportive relationship and successful results.
Achieving employee buy-in can be as easy as explaining the context of an employee’s work and the importance of that work within the organization. As tempting as it is to try to influence employee buy-in with the use of carrots and sticks, monetary or other tangible rewards are not a panacea.
According to Lisa Lai, leadership consultant, e-learning badges, points, or progressing through course levels can be enough to pique the interest of workers, and similar gamification strategies have become prominent corporate e-learning trends. E-learning games provide an environment in which employees learn, often without even realizing it, and provide personal development opportunities that enhance the employee experience.
50 % | The number of respondents in a CareerBuilder survey who found that employee recognition — in the form of awards, cash prizes, and company trips — encourage employees to stay with a company.
5. Embrace New Technology Solutions
Design thinking is a framework for reorienting leadership. And there’s a lot to cover. But there are many new agile solutions that can simplify employee management using intelligent systems and the right strategy for transformation.
When considering any technology changes, however, decisions should be made with the input of IT specialists who understand the organization’s needs, the technology involved, and the security issues implicated. Systems should be installed with an eye to the future, and the infrastructure should support future add-ons.
Financial and accounting specialists should weigh in on the budgetary constraints, and leaders must understand what the changes will entail in terms of staff training and possible capital reductions.
Leaders should also consider the possibility of outsourcing various functions, which might have fewer risk implications. The right companies have experts in their fields with access to the latest knowledge and up-to-date software solutions. Consultants can assess the status of your organization, define where you need to be, and outline how to get there.
In a nutshell then, for leadership for innovation, apply design thinking, an approach that has already proven its worth. From here, evaluate the culture and the corporate environment, and prioritize the employee experience. Because if you build a great culture, ideas will come.
The employment climate has become fiercely competitive, and managing, retaining, and developing talent is crucial to achieving competitive innovation for the future.
“Perhaps the biggest challenge for HR in leading engagement programs is shifting from a transactional, once-a-year mindset, to an always on, continuous listening approach to monitoring engagement.”

Retaining Employees: How to Keep and Develop the Best Talent
What do Japanese culture and talent management for innovation have in common? In a word, “Kaizen.” Kaizen is a Japanese term that describes a sustained, long-term strategy to create incremental changes and improvements in processes over time.
Staff retention is a crucial component in talent management for innovation, and it requires a similar approach. Like Kaizen, it must be sustained, always “on,” and engage those involved – in this case, employees. Staff retention and management are not things to be discussed annually and then tabled for later prioritization.
Here are some insights into talent management and employee engagement:
1: Keep Staff Committed, Engaged, and Resentment Free
Carly Guthrie is an HR expert and leader. In an interview with First Round Review, she provides insights from her role as an HR consultant for tech companies, explaining why people quit and what employers can do to keep staff committed and engaged.
Guthrie finds that even mild feelings of anger, boredom, or dissatisfaction can cause someone to turn to a recruiter and consider switching employers. According to Guthrie, one reason why employees become disengaged and ultimately quit is because work encroaches on family time. For example, a manager might consider a happy hour good for building camaraderie, but if a happy hour is scheduled on a Friday, workers leave the office late, get stuck in traffic, and arrive home to their family late.
A company might schedule an early Monday morning meeting so that everyone can start the week on the same page, but this causes difficulties for staff who need to get their kids to school. It also cuts short employees’ weekends.
Guthrie wants employers to be more aware of workers’ needs and to respect employees’ personal time. Doing so will prevent feelings of resentment from seeping into the culture and will promote goodwill.
2: Promote Goodwill
The ideal workplace model is a community with purpose where people are so engaged in collaborating that they feel they are part of something bigger and important. For some workers, the option to work remotely is a clear motivator, and flexibility in work schedules is an often-cited need. However, remote work runs counter to the idea of building a sense of community and a unified culture.
The digital era has resulted in more team-based work; collaborative platforms and real-time solutions provide immediate communication, transfer of knowledge, and ultimately innovation. This transformation has occurred so rapidly that some companies that were actively promoting a remote work policy have decided to pull workers back into the office.
According to a group of human capital consultants for Deloitte, 38 percent of companies are functionally organized, which implies that around 60 percent have cross-functional teams. One organization studied was composed of 30,000 constantly shifting teams. The level of collaboration was such that remote work was too isolating for effective innovation to occur.
According to Rebecca Greenfield, contributor to Bloomberg, IBM Corporation, in an attempt to increase falling revenues, nixed working from home for 2,000 U.S. workers, and another 2,000 or so were asked to come to the office more often. The company was hoping that doing so would lead to more productivity and innovation. But IBM realizes that the challenge is to maintain goodwill with employees. Therefore, the company provides flexibility for some workers for whom close collaboration is less crucial, and employees can work from home to accommodate appointments and care needs.

3: Use Intelligent Mentoring and Staff Development Programs
Guthrie’s recommendation with respect to mentoring is to identify the skills that a person would benefit from acquiring by listening to their opinion and monitoring their progress. For mentoring, the pairing between mentor and mentee should make sense, and the rationale behind the pairing needs to be communicated to both parties.
An advantage of mentoring is that there is an immediate feedback loop, and it can be easier to spot a problem that might influence retention. Mentoring relationships are almost informal check-ins when it comes to employee satisfaction, and employees are more likely to confide in mentors if they feel dissatisfied and attracted to external opportunities. Trust is a large component of mentoring relationships; however, and they should be used to ensure employee development is on the right track, not as a performance management tool.

4: Train Leaders to Have an Hr Mindset
Those who work in HR understand that managing employees is not about algorithms and digital technology, it’s about having empathy for concerns, building and managing relationships, and communicating. These are all traits that managers require, and managers should be trained to respond to the questions and issues that HR professionals face. If employees feel safe and comfortable enough to talk to their managers and leaders about problems, that’s a healthy culture.
5: Prioritize the Employee Experience
Employee engagement requires satisfying the wants and desires of workers, so it is worth finding out what motivates them and what they look for in an employer. According to the Best Practice Institute, people who love their workplaces were 94 percent more likely to perform better and 95 percent more likely to stay.
For example, Sarah Landrum, digital marketing specialist and author, explained that Millennials are attracted to companies that are involved in corporate social responsibility (CSR) because they want to work for the greater good. Companies that are active in CSR can use that to their advantage in their branding and marketing to attract and retain talent. As consumers, Millennials are already influencing brands to implement CSR in their operations.
“Millennials prefer to do business with corporations and brands with pro-social messages, sustainable manufacturing methods, and ethical business standards.”
— Sarah Landrum, digital marketing specialist and contributor to Forbes, 2017
Bring Talent Management to the Digital Era
The steps involved in listening to feedback, processing feedback, and taking actionable steps to address employee needs and concerns must be an ongoing process. However, it’s incredibly resource-intensive.
For that reason, HR leaders rarely have the required resources and are often unaware that there may be a retention problem until it is too late. Digital talent management solutions can constantly gauge the level of employee satisfaction and engagement and alert HR professionals that there may be a growing problem.
Staff surveys, for example, use employee feedback to gauge employee sentiment. From these data, changes can be instituted to improve the employee environment. These tools can be used in place of or as a supplement to the traditional performance review process. The advantage of using these systems is that staff retention can be managed before it becomes a bottom-line problem.
Real-time employee engagement platforms are another tool through which to take the pulse of workers, identify what drives them, create programs to improve engagement, provide managers with data insights and dashboards to help them take action, alert them to changes or outlier scores, and identify and fix engagement loops before they become problematic.
Stephanie Czajka, PR consultant, provides examples of engagement platforms include: Highground, which allows employees to set and track quarterly goals; PostBeyond, a platform on which employees can post and share articles; and WooBoard, where staff are rewarded for interacting.
Granted, these new solutions are without an established track record just yet, but digital solutions can offer a way to ensure that your company is successfully engaging employees. It makes sense that leaders take all the precautions they can to manage their most important asset for innovation in the digital age: talent.",3487

About This Guide:
In this analysis on entrepreneurial mentorship, we explain why most Fortune 500 companies are incorporating mentoring as a valuable tool in their talent development, we present critical analyses of the concept, and we detail examples of existing mentorship programs. We also parse the latest data and information on mentoring to provide an overview for those who want to use mentoring to maximize their development and advancement efforts.
Finding empirical evidence on the value of mentorship programs is difficult. In part, this is due to a lack of theoretical frameworks for entrepreneurial mentoring – a lack of an understanding from which we can develop a strategy, measure results, and identify meaning from mentorship activities.
Compounding the relative lack of qualitative data on the value of mentoring is an ongoing debate among psychologists as to whether entrepreneurism is an innate talent or can be learned. Some think that people either have an entrepreneurial bent or they don’t and that resources spent on mentoring to foster creativity and corporate innovation are better spent elsewhere.
The truth is that theoretical perspectives on mentoring relationships are constantly changing due to workforce demographics, increased diversity, and shifting work-life demands, which alter employees’ needs, expectations, and work relationships. Our research, available data, and case studies show, however, that even in the absence of established frameworks or the consensus of psychologists, mentorship in many forms benefits both mentors and mentees. We also argue that while not everyone possesses the drive or the inclination to become an entrepreneur, the skills required to do so can be learned.
A mentor can be a strong presence during times of both stability and transition, and industry leaders are using mentoring to gain competitive advantage. A Stanford University executive coaching survey found that 80 percent of CEOs received some form of mentorship and in a Sage study, 93 percent of startups stated that mentorship is integral to success. According to a study from the American Society for Training and Development, 70 percent of Fortune 500 companies provide mentorship opportunities.
And it’s not just tech companies who have stopped debating the merits of and started investing in mentorship programs. Consider the following match-ups: Eric Schmidt mentored Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin; Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg was mentored by Steve Jobs; and Steve Jobs was mentored by Mike Markkula, an early investor and executive at Apple.
The Data Behind Mentorship
Stanford Engineering’s Edmund L. Andrews describes a study by Charles Eesley and Yanbo Wang (Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing) consisting of a randomized four-year trial that tracked the career paths of Stanford students working on a new business concept as part of a class on entrepreneurship.
Three-quarters of the students had hopes of starting their own companies. Most had a high tolerance for risk and around 31 percent said they had a parent who had been an entrepreneur. Student teams were randomly paired up with mentors, and just over 60 percent of the teams received mentors who had started their own companies.
Two years after graduation, approximately 34 percent of the students had started or joined a new company. Mentors who had been entrepreneurs were most effective at spurring students to pursue entrepreneurial careers: 37 percent of the students who had entrepreneur-mentors started or joined new companies compared to 28 percent of those whose mentors were not entrepreneurs. Among students who had no intention of starting a company, having an entrepreneur for a mentor increased the likelihood that they would start a company from 6 to 16 percent.
It’s true in this study, however, that the parental effect was strong and overwhelmed the mentor effect. According to Eesley and Wang, people who come from entrepreneurial families have benefited from family members acting as mentors, whereas people who do not come from entrepreneurial families are more likely to be concerned with failure. Around 26 percent of studied students that came from an entrepreneurial family eventually became entrepreneurs themselves, even though they had no initial plans to do so. While both types of people can benefit from a mentor, this study does find that people who have never been exposed to entrepreneurship could benefit from the encouragement, skills, and confidence that come from having a mentor.
The Mowgli Foundation is a not-for-profit mentoring organization for the Middle East and Africa that is premised on the notion that mentoring is a highly effective way to improve personal growth and leadership. Founder Tony Bury credits his own business success to the mentors who encouraged his development, and he wanted others to benefit in the same way through the Foundation. Bury spent over 40 years in the Middle East and North Africa region, and he believes that developing leaders and supporting entrepreneurship ecosystems could be a solution to the region’s economic challenges, such as unemployment and poverty.

The Foundation has monitored its mentoring efforts since its inception in 2008. The results shown in the table, below, confirm that mentoring is an effective way to encourage growth and advancement. These findings are a valuable source for developing mentorship theory.
Employee Mentoring Modelskeys to Successful Mentor/mentee Relationships
“Mentoring is a two-way process with the mentor having as much to gain as the mentee. The crux is to encourage both partners to contribute freely and operate as equals.” 
— Hay, 1995
Definitions of a mentor vary. Consider the following:
“influential individuals with advanced experience and knowledge who are committed to providing upward mobility and support to their protégés’ careers” –  Ragins, 1997
“guide, counselor, and sponsor” – Levinson et al. (1978)
Some definitions distinguish mentoring from other developmental relationships, such as counseling and coaching, by the emotional components of the relationship – the need for trust between the mentor and the mentee – or the hierarchical distance between the mentor and the mentee.
Although the terms are often conflated, there are significant differences between mentoring, coaching, and counseling. The differentiation is important because for mentoring to produce the desired results – better-skilled, more knowledgeable employees – the mentoring strategy should follow a best-practice model and not become a coaching or counseling exercise. A mentoring relationship that morphs into general counseling can lose sight of the initial goals as the involved parties inevitably segue into other areas.
The graphic, below, from the Mowgli Foundation shows how mentoring (positioned on the far left, highlighted in yellow) is one component of the entrepreneurship ecosystem and a subset of human resources development. It is separate from coaching or training (positioned at the bottom, under capacity building).

According to the American Psychological Association, a mentor fulfills two main functions for the mentee: 1) a career-related function, providing advice to enhance the mentee’s professional performance and development, and 2) a psychosocial function, as a role model and support system for the mentee.
Mentoring is distinguished by its long-term impact in a broader learning context and by its influence on a company’s ability to gain competitive advantage through personnel development. Mentoring is a long-term investment in human capital development.
Mentoring Models
The Institute for Clinical Research Education at the University of Pittsburgh describes five different mentoring models: one-on-one mentoring, team mentoring, multiple mentoring, peer mentoring, and distance mentoring. And these models are distinguished by the following factors, explored in greater detail, below: breadth of perspective, mentor-mentee relative experience, and members’ proximity.
Breadth of Mentor Perspective
Each model varies in terms of the proximity of the players involved and the breadth of perspective that the mentor-mentee relationship provides. In a one-on-one mentoring relationship, for example, there are only two individuals involved and there is only one perspective – that of the mentor. That perspective is limited, then, depending on the knowledge and experience of the particular mentor. This model provides the least diversity in perspective.
Team mentoring, multiple mentoring, or distance mentoring models allow for greater perspective because there are more individuals involved (and more experts in the case of the multiple mentoring model). On the other hand, mentees can experience Mentor Whiplash when they receive differing opinions and feedback.
Peer mentoring occurs among colleagues at similar points in their career; breadth of perspective, therefore, requires senior mentors who have experienced the different stages of development.
Degree of Collaboration
In terms of collaboration, one-on-one mentoring is the least effective model. The multiple mentoring model is also limited in terms of collaboration because the mentee meets with each mentor individually, rather than working with a group of people. In a group setting with multiple peers or mentors, the mentee can tackle conflicting advice and situations without feeling a need to follow one specific path.
The Peer-Onsite-Distance (POD) model is a collaborative, team mentoring model developed in 2002 by researchers at the University of Arkansas. It is described as “a targeted, multilevel mentoring prototype … tailored to the unique needs of underrepresented minority (URM) medical school faculty.” The model is designed to retain talent and advance faculty careers by providing them with adequate network and mentor support.
Through the POD model, a network of peer and faculty mentors provide career guidance and, within the network, leaders and experts in specific fields provide information, such as announcements of future resources or potential restrictions in academic medicine. Different levels of expertise are built into the model:
Peer mentors are “other faculty members of similar rank that offer advice based on their own experiences and provide support.”
Onsite mentors are “senior faculty who address content areas and may also perform the roles of ‘advocates, liaisons, or coaches.’” These onsite mentors may have several mentees at a time, depending upon availability.
Distance mentors are “from academia, the corporate world, government, and politics,” and “these mentors make a one year commitment.”
This structure provides mentees with a unique support system for dealing with different issues.

Proximity between Mentor and Mentee
A model requiring multiple parties to meet at a certain time can be difficult to organize. Tools such as Skype or Zoom can ease geographic scheduling difficulties. If external expertise is required, digital communication platforms can facilitate distance mentoring.
E-mentoring is gaining popularity because of its convenience, particularly among younger generations and in learning institutions, and there are emerging platforms offering online mentoring for businesses. Management Mentors, for example, offers extensive e-mentoring programs and models.
The Different Types of Mentors
Mentors can serve in a psychological support capacity, providing reassurance and motivation. In this case, the mentor-mentee relationship and the mentor’s role as confidante grows over time. Mentors can also act as role models, with mentees attempting to emulate mentor behaviors that led to success. Finally, mentors can provide professional guidance such as career advice.
Research studies acknowledge the range of different roles that mentors can play. In 2011, Etienne St-Jean conducted an in-depth qualitative analysis of entrepreneurial mentorships using focus groups of 51 novice entrepreneur-mentees and eight experienced entrepreneur-mentors. St- Jean confirmed in mentors four psychological functions, four career-related functions, and one role-modeling function.
Elin Kubberoed and Svein Thore Hagen studied two core dimensions of entrepreneurial mentoring: “mentoring focus” and “objective-orientation.” The authors developed a model with four similar generic roles with corresponding mentoring strategies: 1) “The role model” and modeling; 2) “The expert” and counseling; 3) “The learning facilitator” and reflection; and 4) “The coach” and coaching. Consider each in turn.
Role Models – According to Kubberoed and Hagen, the role model sets the example to be emulated by aspiring entrepreneurs, “learning by example.” Role models are particularly influential in the startup phase. The expert role model provides direct advice on what to do regarding a particular matter. Management knowledge is learned from experts and their experiences.
Learning Facilitators – A learning facilitator arranges the right environment for learning and guides the learning process by asking open-ended questions. There is no specific goal; learners practice critical thinking and are responsible for their own actions and learning process.
Coaches – A coach works with the learner toward a mutual goal in the same way that a sports coach and a student work together to achieve better performance. Kubberoed and Hagen found that the success of entrepreneurial coaching is dependent on whether the learner is ready to change their attitudes and behaviors.
What Does the Mentoring Relationship Look Like?
Mentoring is characterized by the relationship between the mentor and the mentee. It is a long-term activity, partly because it takes time to build the mutual trust that allows the relationship to develop.
According to a literature review from Dana L. Haggard, Thomas W. Dougherty, Daniel B. Turban, and James E. Wilbanks, the mentor-mentee relationship has three core-attributes: reciprocity, developmental benefits, and regular/consistent interaction over some period.
Reciprocity is a mutual social exchange as opposed to a one-way relationship. A mentee must have respect for the mentor and an appreciation for the knowledge that he or she will impart. A mentor must believe that the mentee is willing to apply themselves to the opportunity to gain knowledge and develop skills.
This transfer of knowledge and skill is especially important in circumstances that are subject to high levels of uncertainty, such as innovation and entrepreneurship. Individuals engaged in these activities are often dealing with problems that haven’t been solved and with technologies or methodologies that haven’t been adequately taught in formal education systems. The extended reciprocal nature of mentorship allows for novel problem solving.
According to the American Psychological Association, a mentor-mentee relationship has four distinct stages, and it can be helpful for participants to have insight into how the relationship develops:
1. The initiation stage is where formal or informal matching occurs.
2. Cultivation is the early stage of learning and development within the mentoring relationship.
3. Separation occurs at the end of a program/relationship (hopefully after program goals have been met).
4. At the redefinition stage, the mentor-mentee relationship may transform into a collegial or more social friendship.

Building a Mentorship Program
“The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves.”
— Steven Spielberg
Designing and implementing an effective program requires substantial upfront planning. In 7 Steps to Creating a Lasting Learning Culture, Horace McCormack Program Director of UNC Executive Development at the Kenan-Flagler Business School, highlights the numerous steps that program organizers must take before launching a mentorship program.
A crucial first step is setting the program objectives. HR talent managers are best equipped to identify the needs of mentees and to determine the goals of the program. Through a needs assessment, program developers can identify skills gaps or organizational weaknesses that the mentoring program should address.
Metrics follow, and plans for monitoring the progress and evaluating the success of the mentoring program must be developed before program launch to ensure effective assessments. Additionally, expectations should be set around program structure, duration, and type of mentoring so that participants are aware of what the experience will look like and what they are expected to achieve in the set timeframe.
Identifying and matching mentee needs with mentor skills is incredibly important. The matching process should be one that suits the company culture, and it should be perceived as fair by the participants. We consider matching in further detail in the section below.
Additionally, there should be a training strategy for both mentors and mentees. According to McCormick “it is recommended that mentors and mentees are trained together in pairs. Pairs should be taught what mentoring is, preferably in a formal, classroom-style setting and led by a professional trainer with mentoring expertise.”
After program launch – and for the duration of a mentorship program – the most important factor is communication. Participants must be kept informed at all stages, from the needs assessment to the conclusion. They should have a way to monitor progress and a mechanism for providing constructive feedback on the program. Transparency is crucial to get the buy-in and commitment of all involved.
Matching Mentors and Mentees
Organizations must carefully plan a mentoring program in order to facilitate successful matches between mentors and mentees. This can be one of the more challenging aspects of developing a mentorship program, according to the authors of “Mentoring an Entrepreneur: Guide for a Mentor.”
Matching can be done in one of two ways: self-matching or administrative matching. The former has the advantage of being logistically easier and gives the participants more of a say in the matching process. For large groups or more structured mentorship programs, such as those sponsored in a large organization, administrative or bulk matching might be less complex.
Regardless of how the matching occurs, mentor-mentee combinations need to be verified for a good fit. Each participant in a mentoring relationship brings unique competencies, backgrounds, learning styles, and needs.
In “Mentoring an Entrepreneur,” the authors differentiate between different types of entrepreneurs and the types of mentors that are complementary to each.
Creative Entrepreneurs “unearth novel industry that needs resources, either financial or human capital, such as knowledge and skills to offer solutions to problems of customers.” These entrepreneurs require mentors with similar creative and opportunistic bents.
Technology Entrepreneurs are those who “successfully use[] talent and venture capital, innovative ideas, and managerial skills for either commercial production of effective and viable technological innovations or effective leverage of innovations using technology.” These “technopreneurs” need to attain managerial competencies from mentors to sustain technology-based ventures.
Knowledge Entrepreneurs are “capable of producing and using intellectual assets of self for the growth of new start-up or services that can later guide entrepreneurs to prosperity and wealth creation of community and provide better and superior services.” This entrepreneur requires a mentor that is similarly endowed with intellectual capital and practical experience.
Understanding and assessing where a mentee is situated professionally can help one gauge whether a mentoring relationship can be successful. Applied to the entrepreneur categories, above, for example: a “technopreneur” at the “conception” phase might not need entrepreneurial mentoring because they are already an independent decision maker – but they might benefit from a psychological mentor who could improve their communication or people skills.
It is also important to consider how factors like race and gender affect participants and learning styles in mentoring relationships. For sources of empirical research on race and gender considerations, see:
Shanon A. Hunter, Jubilee J. Dickson, Steven Diamond, and Jared B. Kenworthy on gender, race, and organizational context
Gibb, 1997; Spender, 1996a on gender and learning styles in mentorship relationships
Ignatius Ekanem, “Entrepreneurial Learning: Gender Differences,” on gender and critical learning incidents
These studies raise awareness around the complexity of mentorship relationship. Program managers must take special care to make sure programs don’t further entrench a company’s lack of diversity.

Making Mentoring Work
“selling” Mentorship
For a mentorship program to work, the mentee must be willing to learn and eager to make the most of the experience. According to Chronus.com:
“When new mentoring programs are introduced in organizations, there is generally natural enthusiasm. Yet this enthusiasm doesn’t always translate into high participation rates. A common reason is the absence of effective promotion. Don’t assume potential mentors and mentees understand the benefits.”
— Chronus
Enthusiasm for a mentorship program can be boosted by educating potential participants, key leaders, and stakeholders on the benefits of the program and the value to the organization. Also, remember that mentors have needs too. There should be incentives for them to participate and the practical aspects should make the process an easy and enjoyable one. Implementing recognition and reward strategies, and using the right communication channels, can make the process seamless.",4313

About the Guide
Communities of Practice (CoPs) were called “The New Frontier” by Etienne C. Wenger and William M. Snyder, anthropologists and experts on CoPs and social engineering. Wenger and Snyder predicted in 2000 that CoPs, also known as learning networks or thematic groups, would be central to the learning activities of leading knowledge institutions. They were right.
The goals of CoPs are to build, protect, and retain corporate knowledge; communities also strive to promote learning among members. Members join a CoP voluntarily based on a shared interest and eventually move from a state of peripheral engagement to full participation. It is, therefore, this collective social practice that links individuals together across official organizational boundaries and departments – and beyond – to create the community.
CoPs are key tools used by companies to capture and store the knowledge that exists in the white space of an organization: the culture, the conversations, the workflow. Organizations such as the World Bank and American Management Systems, a high-technology and management consultancy firm, stand out for their fostering and leveraging of CoPs and the application of the resulting knowledge to their operations.
But many organizations are failing to provide the infrastructure to facilitate such communities. These structures are needed to capture institutional and individual knowledge, both of which are lost when employees leave an organization. This last point is important because tenure among Gen-Y and Gen-X workers at companies is shortening. The median tenure with an employer for Gen-Xers is now five years and for Gen-Yers is just two years, according to Payscale.com. With the rapid turnover of core staff and the competition for talent heating up, companies need to both maximize the talent and knowledge that they have in their communities and retain it.
Building Successful Communities of Practice
“Most of our intelligence doesn’t reside in our brain, it is externalized as our civilization, our culture. A standalone human is just an app”
— Francois Chollet, AI and deep learning researcher, Google, Quote via Twitter.
The Structure of Communities of Practice and the Role of Cultural and Behavioral ChangeThe first article in this series on CoPs defines CoPs and explains how companies and organizations can structure an environment conducive to community productivity. This article describes the components required to develop communities and explores how to stimulate the cultural change that is part of the process.
What Is a Community of Practice?
Communities of Practice (CoPs) – also known as learning networks, thematic groups, or tech clubs – are one of many tools that organizations are using to improve knowledge dissemination, facilitate learning, and stimulate creativity.
Etienne Wenger and Beverly Wenger-Trayner are anthropologists and experts on CoPs and social engineering. They describe a CoP as a group of people who collectively learn in an area of shared interest. For example, a group of researchers working on a similar problem are a CoP, as are a group of surgeons who are exploring a new technique or a group of first-time managers who are supporting each other as they gain confidence.
To qualify as a CoP, a group must have three components: the domain, the community, and the practice:
First, the domain is exemplified by the common interest that distinguishes members from others – a group of programmers, for example, share the art of coding.
Second, the community is represented by the sharing of information and the interaction among the community members on the matter of common interest.
Lastly, the practice is the actual art of “doing,” or performing tasks that are related to and improved by the discussions within the community.
CoPs learn in different ways. They might problem solve and brainstorm, they might share information and seek out others who have more experience, they might share or reuse assets.
Membership in a CoP is voluntary, and members typically come and go and participate in other CoPs. This is advantageous to all involved because it extends the group’s diversity and the range of sources for ideas. The number of participants varies; however, in his book, “The Tipping Point,” Malcolm Gladwell documents several examples where companies or organizations have found that optimally efficient group sizes include 150 members or less.
Developing CoPs in the corporate environment is one way to achieve competitive advantage, because a community of like-minded, driven people can develop new ideas while building strong, collaborative relationships. CoPs are difficult to catalyze, however, because they are a byproduct of corporate culture. They develop organically in the right environment, but the difficulty lies in creating that environment and encouraging the desired behaviors that will capture and disseminate information within the community.
The Value of Cops for Organizations
Many organizations do a poor job at retaining both individual learning and incremental organizational knowledge. Staff development programs can use up valuable resources that many companies feel are better spent on R&D, for example. But the advantage of CoPs is that the learning they facilitate and the advancements they promote occur organically once the basic components are established.
Wenger and William M. Snyder, founding partner of Social Capital Group, recount the following CoP example in an article in the Harvard Business Review. At Hill’s Pet Nutrition facility in Richmond, Indiana, line technicians formed a group to help the company develop and retain technical expertise. The group meets weekly to discuss successes, frustrations, and challenges, and it has a “mayor” who keeps things on track and ensures the group has access to the right expertise when needed.
Throughout the course of its meetings, this community explored various concepts and ideas, generating a proposal to substitute pneumatic tubes for a conveyor belt that carried pet food kibbles to the packaging bin. After some back and forth between management and the community on the new concept, the company ultimately installed the new technology, which resulted in fewer downtimes and less pet food wasted during the packaging process.
If the right environment is created, then, learning should be a natural outcome of a community. This explains the value of CoPs for the corporate organization.
CoPs embody ambient learning, whereby learning occurs as a result of the environment. Khan Academy, for example, is a “one-to-many” broadcast model that lifts students to a certain proficiency level. CoPs build an environment where people of all skill levels learn simultaneously. There are no boundaries to the learning, and newcomers can participate immediately.
What process should an organization take to leverage and build CoPs?
Types of Communities of Practice
Fred Nickol, Managing Partner of Distance Consulting, LLC, suggests that there are two types of CoPs: self-organized and sponsored. The former can exist within an organization, and these CoPs are resistant to efforts to manage or control their direction. Members tend to come and go as the focus of the community changes and the community adapts. Sponsored CoPs are initiated and supported by management, and they are expected to produce measurable results that benefit the company. These communities receive resources as would cross-functional teams, but they have greater autonomy.
The World Bank Group creates internal CoPs called “Thematic Groups.” These groups work on difficult issues such as poverty, transportation, and infrastructure development. Hallmarks of these groups include: leaders and facilitators; a critical mass of active members; management support; resources; emphasis on problem-solving; focus on knowledge transfer and dissemination mechanisms; member trust and passion; etc.
The Disciplined Agile Framework, created by the Digital Agile Consortium, is another example of a sponsored CoP and includes CoPs as part of a software development process using agile.

Designing Cops: From the Call to Action to the Feedback Loop
The creator of ZeroMQ, the late-Pieter Hintjens, identified guidelines for creating a community. The guidelines, broken down into 20 unique dimensions, are useful for organizations that want to create a culture conducive to CoPs without forcing the dynamics. While this resource is directed towards online communities, it is very easily applied to communities within organizations and communities that extend beyond organizational boundaries.
The dimensions include the following:
“strong mission,” which is the stated reason for the group’s existence;
“free entry,” which describes how easy it is for people to join the group;
“transparency,” which is how openly and publicly decisions are made;
“decentralization,” which is how widely the group is spread out; and
“sense of humor” – i.e., how seriously the group takes itself.
Hintjens’ guide aligns closely with three core parameters that define a CoP: a call to action, frictionless collaboration, and a feedback loop.
The Call to Action
While CoPs develop organically once a shared goal becomes evident, it is helpful within an organization to consider what the desired type of community might look like in order to facilitate the creation of the right environment and culture.
Asking certain questions can indicate what changes an organization should make. “What goals, agenda, or mission will the community serve – and are these learning, membership, or assessment goals?” The answer(s) to this question would highlight what types of metrics an organization might use to monitor CoP activities. “Does the community’s technology infrastructure need to be integrated within broader information systems?” The answer to this question would help identify if the existing organizational infrastructure is going to stymie CoP efforts.
Once the right environment has been created, a well-constructed call to action can stimulate collaboration or learning. The call to action should be a simple, idealistic statement communicated through a channel that is popular among the target community audience. The call to action should speak to the early adopters of the community because these contributors will influence the initial community and bring it to critical mass.
For more on communication resources, read “Communication Technologies in Today’s Organizations.”
But crafting a simple, idealistic statement is easier than it sounds. Christina Xu, ethnographer and writer for Chrysaora Weekly, said the following about the call to action signal: “Whether it’s an invitation to an event, a call to action, a piece of art, or a literal flare, the signal is how you get the attention of the people you are trying to gather. Sometimes, it can also be a shibboleth to filter out who you don’t want, a way to indicate who the community is safe for and from.”
Xu emphasizes that the art of crafting a good signal requires marketing, communications, SEO, and media expertise. The primary concern is creating a compelling message so that the audience will connect on their own terms.
Frictionless Collaboration
CoPs should be fluid. The leaders in any community tend to be the most experienced participants but, in the interests of diversity, a cross-section in terms of experience is preferable to maximize the likelihood that new ideas will emerge. Those with experience could deter others from challenging their already established modes of operating. Also, in a more structured or sponsored community, membership terms could be structured so that the community is replenished with new people and ideas annually or semi-annually.
For communities to thrive, organizations should remove as much friction as possible. Friction occurs from a variety of sources, including communication tools, proximity, and organizational structure, but different tools can remove friction and facilitate interaction.
The table, below, shows which tools are best for achieving certain tasks such as communicating announcements, obtaining feedback from the community, and rewarding the community for contributing.

The Feedback Loop
A CoP is often first formed in an informal and ad hoc manner – a group may have a common area of learning interest and set up in-person or online meetings. If the CoP is worth pursuing, it will benefit from support mechanisms, such as discussion forums and communication channels, that an organization can provide to encourage collaboration and to collect information and feedback. Regular feedback that is incorporated into organizational change is an iterative feedback loop, and the resulting improvements to processes are the essence of the CoP.
CoPs often have momentum in the beginning only to diminish over time or be altogether abandoned. To keep members enthusiastic, the infrastructure should provide ongoing content that participants find valuable and that attracts new members. By constantly pulling people back into the community, and by replenishing the community with new members, the CoP stands a greater chance of longevity.
Although focused on a community as a product, an article by GrowthHackers, a leading community platform, illustrates how to create a feedback loop that keeps members returning. Nir Eyal’s hook model uses internal and external triggers to nudge the audience into participating in and contributing to the community.

Cops and Other Teams
According to the Disciplined Agile Framework, introduced above, a more formal CoP might be initiated by an already existing Center of Excellence (CoE): a group of people with specialized skills and expertise who provide leadership and purposely disseminate that knowledge. A CoE is often funded for a specific knowledge purpose or to support a short-term organizational goal (such as an agile transformation). CoPs, because of their voluntary nature, often last much longer and may eventually replace a CoE.

Behavior & Culture Change
A CoP will thrive in the right environment, but it requires a change in participant behavior that is, in turn, influenced by the environment. According to Rachel Happe, co-founder of The Community Roundtable, “In the initial stages of building a community, the ability to change behavior is the primary success metric. If you can orchestrate behavior change, you can fundamentally shift the economics of a process. Typically, this behavior change is also seen as valuable to community members, and that generates a pull effect that grows the community and normalizes the new behavior.”
Culture change is an even longer process than driving behavior change. According to Deepa Ray’s paper, “Life Cycle of CoPs,” communities go through five distinct and often difficult stages before they create significant value. These stages are the following:
Potential: In the early stages, although members of a community might be aware of their shared or similar situations, there has yet to be an established shared practice.
Coalescing: At this stage, community members begin to interact and to focus on a common focus and common goals.
Maturing: During this period, the CoP sets standards, solidifies relationships, and outlines its agenda.
Active: When shared practices develop and are integrated into group practice, a community enters its most productive stages.
Dispersed: When a CoP begins dispersing and is no longer active, it functions largely as a knowledge repository at this stage.
These five stages also appear in an updated 2001 model by Patricia Gongla and Christine R. Rizzoto. The five stages are described slightly differently as “potential, building, engaged, active, and adaptive.” In the active and adaptive stages, according to the model, the community demonstrates the benefits of the new knowledge it has documented and uses that knowledge to obtain a competitive advantage.
If decision makers understand the slow nature of behavior and culture change, they will be more likely to commit to a long-term effort for community building. As the community matures, it is important that the iterative process be cumulative in terms of development so that knowledge is built and not destroyed. This requires maintaining the integrity of community members.
Moderation is also important. For a community to provide value, it must be focused and relevant. According to The Butler Group, for example, up to 30 percent of knowledge workers’ time is spent searching for data, which is a waste of time and resources. Moreover, according to the IDC, 50 percent of employees’ searches fail to find the relevant data. Poor moderation efforts lead to cluttered, irrelevant knowledge capture which in turn can lead to time-consuming and confusing information searches – accomplishing the exact opposite of what the community set out to do.
But moderation isn’t just cleaning out spam and banning users. It also consists of the careful management of contributions according to community members’ skill level. Allowing non-experts to contribute in a community can hamper its progress. Joel Spolsky, CEO and co-founder of Stack Overflow, a leading platform for coding experts, describes how the company excludes certain types of people from its platform. Smart technology identifies and prohibits non-experts from the site so that the quality of the content is maintained. We discuss Stack Overflow in more detail in the next article.
Knowledge Capture
With CoPs and organizational learning, the goal is to instill behaviors that will capture knowledge. In an article in the Harvard Business Review, “Balancing Act: How to Capture Knowledge Without Killing It,” John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid outline key issues surrounding knowledge capture. They recommend delaying knowledge capture until the group has matured and answers are clear – otherwise, the learning process can be suffocated by bureaucracy. The authors also emphasize that knowledge capture comes from the bottom up; experts in the community should be dictating what is shared, not top-level managers.
Brown and Duguid explain the knowledge capture process as follows:
“A rep submits a suggestion first to a local expert on the topic. Together, they refine the tip. It’s then submitted to a centralized review process, organized according to business units. Here reps and engineers again vet the tips, accepting some, rejecting others, eliminating duplicates, and calling in experts on the particular product line to resolve doubts and disputes. If a tip survives this process, it becomes available to reps around the world who have access to the tips database over the web. So, reps using the system know that the tips – and the database as a whole – are relevant, reliable, and probably not redundant.”
Eventually, feedback loops like the one in the diagram, below, can transform the culture of a company by creating an environment in which people support and challenge one other and build strong relationships.

Metrics and Management for Communities of Practice
“Meaningful learning in a community requires both participation and reification to be present and in interplay. Sharing artifacts without engaging in discussions and activities around them impairs the ability to negotiate the meaning of what is being shared.” 
— Etienne Wenger, Digital Habitats
With any strategy that has difficult-to-quantify improvements as goals – for example, product innovations through better synergies and collaboration – finding concrete positive results is essential to sustaining the inflow of funding and resources. The same is true in the case of Communities of Practice (CoPs).
John Nelson, Project Manager for Dynamics Research Corporation, provides insights on integratingknowledge management with Lean Six Sigma, project management, business process management, and change management with organizations. Nelson studied the U.S. Army’s Center for Army Lessons Learned, which hosts over 60 CoPs.
To develop and obtain meaningful measurements, Nelson identified growth targets (such as membership and knowledge) and activity targets (such as participation) in benchmark communities. He found that one way to measure growth in a community is by member penetration, through which it is possible to measure the total knowledge transfer potential from the increased interactions among members (new and old).
Interactions monitored, for example, include online communications, external email exchanges, and phone discussions, as well as the number of documents uploaded or downloaded. These factors can be used to calculate a replies-to-discussion ratio. The level of vibrancy of any communications, and whether the communications are meeting community needs, are also salient metrics. So are more specific ratios, such as the page-visit-to-member ratio or the active participation rate (Knowledge + Discussions + Replies / Unique Visits), which can reveal if the organization is meeting the community’s needs.
However, although these measurements can assess the community’s success in attracting participation, they do not measure whether learning has actually occurred. For this, Nelson maps activities to objectives to determine the impact of the community knowledge management project on the organization. This is best illustrated through personalizing the data collected on community participation. The engagement metrics aren’t what encourages organizational buy in – it’s the connection to key organizational objectives.
In the case of the U.S. Army, proxy measures are often used to measure, for example, time or money saved. In Nelson’s study, one case reported a particularly powerful outcome of lives saved from CoP activities: “I used the quick notification of the Army Combat Helmet recall and forwarded to my unit supply sergeant to notify soldiers of my unit to check their helmets for the recalled stock numbers. No doubt that has saved lives.”
Hewlett-Packard has an internal CoP composed of the group’s North America-based product delivery consultants. The consultants hold monthly teleconferences to discuss the company’s High Availability software, which was designed to minimize computer downtime. Before the community convened, the consultants were isolated, but the collaboration has brought them together and helped them resolve common problems and learn from their counterparts. The community’s work has included standardizing sales of the product and its pricing, as well as formalizing the installation process. Participants do not have to participate in the meetings, and there is no strict agenda, but discussions that crop up are often valuable to many participants who might be experiencing similar issues.
Finally, with respect to measuring the effects of CoPs on operations and productivity – functions that are traditionally difficult to quantify, can be delayed, and are sometimes apparent only in the work of other teams and units – Wenger and Snyder suggest that the best way to assess value is by listening to members’ stories: “an analysis of stories found that the communities had saved the company $2 million to $5 million and increased revenue by more than $13 million in one year.” At Shell, community coordinators collect stories and publish them in newsletters and reports. American Management Systems organizes a yearly competition to identify the best stories.
Learning From External Online Communities
Engagement Metrics: Examples from GrowthHackers.com
GrowthHackers, an open online community for growth and marketing professionals, has specific metrics that it uses to measure improvements in the user experience. In determining what metrics are most appropriate, GrowthHackers emphasizes the importance of understanding the behaviors and dynamics of its audience.
The company is acutely aware of what it calls the “lurker” effect – whereby visitors benefit from content and community sites without ever logging in, creating an account, or participating. They read and watch the content, but don’t interacte with it (for example, by voting, commenting, or sharing). Jakob Nielsen, a Danish web usability consultant, called this the 90-9-1 rule for communities: only 1 percent of community members actively contribute, 9 percent minimally contribute, and 90 percent “lurk.”
To encourage lurkers to become active participants, GrowthHackers tries to understand and meet the needs of each segment. Because the company wants to provide a learning and growth experience, it measures the quality of its supply-side content, not just the quantity. The company classifies its metrics using Charlene Li’s Engagement Pyramid, which refers to levels of visitor engagement.

Examples of metrics include new visitors and engaged time. More time engaged likely predicts higher engagement in the long term. Subscriptions to newsletters or created accounts is an obvious metric, but GrowthHackers also measures the percentage of visitors who comment or vote on at least one post over a period of a week or a month.
GrowthHackers measures retention by the percentage of visitors who visit the site and return within one week. The company also uses qualitative surveys and net promoter score – an index that measures the consumer’s willingness to recommend – with Qualaroo, a real-time customer decision analysis solution. Other metrics, designed to measure the quality of content, include votes per post, the length of time a post appears on the homepage, and the number of comments on a post.
GrowthHackers tests its framework with a High Tempo Testing (HTT) solution, which has a testing goal of three tests a week. Tracking the right metrics provides the impetus to improve core metrics and determine what changes worked.
Information Quality Signaling and Decentralized Moderation: Examples from Stack Exchange
Although not an internal system, Stack Exchange has effectively built a community – and subsequently captured knowledge – that nearly every programmer has used as a reference. This reference mechanism is what makes the community so powerful. A question asked and answered years ago can save a programmer significant time today. Joel Spolsky gives a fascinating talk on “The Cultural Anthropology of Stack Exchange,” which explains how the company analyzed users’ behaviors to design, build, and improve its platform.
The platform has also motivated contributors by: identifying the best experts within a specific domain and tracking their activity; awarding reputation points to users who showed their technical expertise and contributions; helping talented developers and contributors when they apply for positions.
Stack Overflow, the flagship site of the Stack Exchange network, calls itself “a fusion of a wiki, blog, forum, and social rating website, emphasizing that it is a platform for the open and free exchange of information.”

Stack Overflow is an open platform where programmers can find answers for free and answer other users’ questions for upvotes and reputation purposes. It was originally created as an alternative to clunky and closed Q&A forums which were either algorithm-curated – with a set format question and unsatisfactory answers, such as Askjeeves.com – or human-curated.
In addition, Stack Overflow linked with social media to establish expert credibility. (Quora, for example, has accomplished this.)
Stack Exchange’s initial strategy was to eliminate six key Q&A shortcomings:
sign-up scams where fake Q&A sites solicited contact information;
incorrect answers;
users’ inability to edit incorrect or incomplete responses;
lack of comprehensive answers to complicated programming problems;
inability to find multiple solutions to a question; and
obsolete results.
To maintain the integrity and quality of the content on the platform, intelligent technology identified any potential members who were not experts and prevented them from contributing content.
The founders focused on SEO optimization of content because approximately 90 percent of traffic comes from Google searches. Questions submitted first acted like a search of the initial Q&A database. If there was no relevant content, the user would be one click away from submitting it as a question. This approach – a searchable, living Q&A function – has been incorporated into many organizations as a means of both capturing knowledge from internal CoPs and disseminating information to consumers.
Other building blocks which can be of particular value to company-wide systems were added to the strategy to assist in the discovery and maintenance of quality information:
Voting: Visitor votes on answers are arranged by the number of votes received, and the best answers are displayed at the top. Users gain reputation points when others vote for their questions or answers.
Tags: Every question is tagged, which helps direct questions to experts from a specific field to improve the quality and speed of responses. Users may also customize the Stack Overflow website by specifying tags of interest and filtering out uninteresting ones.
Badges: Stack Overflow introduced the concept of badges. These awards, shown on the user’s profile, are given to users who consistently provide high-quality answers or ask popular and relevant questions.
Karma and Bounties: Karma is a type of currency system that encourages and rewards participation. Users who earn enough karma enjoy special privileges: for example, only a user with sufficient karma can comment on answers and modify questions. Users win karma by selecting the correct and most relevant answer to their questions.
Data Dump: Stack Overflow provides a “data dump,” which stores all the site’s user-generated content under a creative commons license. People can share and change content as long as it is correctly attributed to its author.
Pre-search: Pre-search lays out questions to a user before the user can post a new question. This avoids multiple copies of the same question for better retrieval of relevant answers.
Search Engine Optimization: The site uses various search engine optimization techniques: for example, the URL of a particular page on the site contains keywords from the corresponding topic.
Critical Mass: Atwood and Spolsky promote Stack Overflow and direct traffic to the site using the initial community. Atwood answered questions from the outset so that quality answers were available.
Performance: Built on a Microsoft software stack, Stack Overflow achieves high performance at a very low cost. Spolsky boasts that Stack Overflow’s performance is comparable to websites with similar traffic, but only requires one-tenth of the hardware.
Stack Exchange also helps to ensure quality by carefully managing the creation and growth of new communities.
The original Stack Overflow platform is now being expanded to more topics, and the model helps corporations determine where to allocate resources according to the lifespan of internal CoPs. Every new site created in the Stack Exchange network goes through a detailed review process consisting of six steps:
Discussion: The Stack Exchange meta site provides a forum for discussing potential new ideas.
Proposal: A public proposal is drafted and posted so that any member of the community can discuss the proposal and vote on it.
Commitment: Two hundred users support the site.
Private Beta: If the concept receives 100 percent commitment, committed members publicize and use the site in the private beta phase.
Public Beta: A public period brings the site to its critical mass before launch.
Graduation: The site is fully launched, based on multiple criteria such as the number of answered questions, new questions per day, and registered users.
Stack Overflow is perhaps the purest example of an organization that is nurturing technology advancement and learning by bringing together experts with diverse expertise and experience. Stack Overflow is leveraging its community as a platform provider and the communities that it supports with its technologies. The company’s successes and failures offer important guidance to organizations that are looking to better manage information quality and effectively moderate the flow of information among members in its community.
Calculating Roi From Communities of Practice.
Implementing new tools requires metrics and communication to succeed. A metric familiar to both employees and the c-suite alike is ROI. Return on investment, or ROI, is a battled-tested equation that is used throughout organizations. At its simplest, it measures the efficacy of an investment. For more transparent business areas, calculating ROI is fairly straightforward. This is not the case for communities of practice.
Communities provide value in many ways which aren’t immediately obvious to decision-makers. Customer satisfaction, for example, increases with a successful external community. But rather than attribute the increase to community, it’s often credited to the product team. A similar pattern can be seen with internal communities. Organizational learning and internal troubleshooting can be transformed through communities but the transformation is difficult to capture in business terms.
Communicating Community Value
Translating the complex value from communities into a clear, transparent return on investment is crucial to reap the benefits from this tool. Communities need support and time in order to reach their potential. This is achieved with clearly-communicated metrics.
This isn’t the time for a one-size-fits-all calculation — organizations need to tailor the process to their unique circumstance. A top-down approach, starting from the organization’s business goals ensures the correct focus and allows for the comparison of the community with the rest of the business’s activities.
Given this level of specificity, we’ve collected a variety of resources to help measure community ROI specific to your organization’s business goals. These resources are from the organizations that have deeply studied communities of practice.
